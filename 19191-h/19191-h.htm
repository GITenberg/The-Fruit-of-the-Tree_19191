<h2>I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the surgical ward of the Hope Hospital at Hanaford,
a nurse was bending over a young man
whose bandaged right hand and arm lay stretched
along the bed.</p>

<p>His head stirred uneasily, and slipping her arm behind
him she effected a professional readjustment of
the pillows. "Is that better?"</p>

<p>As she leaned over, he lifted his anxious bewildered
eyes, deep-sunk under ridges of suffering. "I don't
s'pose there's any kind of a show for me, is there?" he
asked, pointing with his free hand&mdash;the stained seamed
hand of the mechanic&mdash;to the inert bundle on the quilt.</p>

<p>Her only immediate answer was to wipe the dampness
from his forehead; then she said: "We'll talk
about that to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why not now?"</p>

<p>"Because Dr. Disbrow can't tell till the inflammation
goes down."</p>

<p>"Will it go down by to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"It will begin to, if you don't excite yourself and
keep up the fever."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[p 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Excite myself? I&mdash;there's four of 'em at home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then there are four reasons for keeping quiet,"
she rejoined.</p>

<p>She did not use, in speaking, the soothing inflection
of her trade: she seemed to disdain to cajole or trick
the sufferer. Her full young voice kept its cool note of
authority, her sympathy revealing itself only in the
expert touch of her hands and the constant vigilance
of her dark steady eyes. This vigilance softened to
pity as the patient turned his head away with a groan.
His free left hand continued to travel the sheet, clasping
and unclasping itself in contortions of feverish
unrest. It was as though all the anguish of his mutilation
found expression in that lonely hand, left
without work in the world now that its mate was
useless.</p>

<p>The nurse felt a touch on her shoulder, and rose to
face the matron, a sharp-featured woman with a soft
intonation.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Amherst, Miss Brent. The assistant
manager from the mills. He wishes to see Dillon."</p>

<p>John Amherst's step was singularly noiseless. The
nurse, sensitive by nature and training to all physical
characteristics, was struck at once by the contrast between
his alert face and figure and the silent way in
which he moved. She noticed, too, that the same contrast
was repeated in the face itself, its spare energetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[p 5]</a></span>
outline, with the high nose and compressed lips of the
mover of men, being curiously modified by the veiled
inward gaze of the grey eyes he turned on her. It was
one of the interests of Justine Brent's crowded yet
lonely life to attempt a rapid mental classification of
the persons she met; but the contradictions in Amherst's
face baffled her, and she murmured inwardly
"I don't know" as she drew aside to let him approach
the bed. He stood by her in silence, his hands clasped
behind him, his eyes on the injured man, who lay
motionless, as if sunk in a lethargy. The matron, at
the call of another nurse, had minced away down the
ward, committing Amherst with a glance to Miss Brent;
and the two remained alone by the bed.</p>

<p>After a pause, Amherst moved toward the window
beyond the empty cot adjoining Dillon's. One of the
white screens used to isolate dying patients had been
placed against this cot, which was the last at that
end of the ward, and the space beyond formed a
secluded corner, where a few words could be exchanged
out of reach of the eyes in the other beds.</p>

<p>"Is he asleep?" Amherst asked, as Miss Brent
joined him.</p>

<p>Miss Brent glanced at him again. His voice betokened
not merely education, but something different
and deeper&mdash;the familiar habit of gentle speech; and
his shabby clothes&mdash;carefully brushed, but ill-cut and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[p 6]</a></span>
worn along the seams&mdash;sat on him easily, and with the
same difference.</p>

<p>"The morphine has made him drowsy," she answered.
"The wounds were dressed about an hour
ago, and the doctor gave him a hypodermic."</p>

<p>"The wounds&mdash;how many are there?"</p>

<p>"Besides the hand, his arm is badly torn up to the
elbow."</p>

<p>Amherst listened with bent head and frowning brow.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the case?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "Dr. Disbrow hasn't said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it's not your business to?" He smiled slightly.
"I know hospital etiquette. But I have a particular reason
for asking." He broke off and looked at her again,
his veiled gaze sharpening to a glance of concentrated
attention. "You're not one of the regular nurses, are
you? Your dress seems to be of a different colour."</p>

<p>She smiled at the "seems to be," which denoted a
tardy and imperfect apprehension of the difference
between dark-blue linen and white.</p>

<p>"No: I happened to be staying at Hanaford, and
hearing that they were in want of a surgical nurse, I
offered my help."</p>

<p>Amherst nodded. "So much the better. Is there
any place where I can say two words to you?"</p>

<p>"I could hardly leave the ward now, unless Mrs.
Ogan comes back."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[p 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care to have you call Mrs. Ogan," he interposed
quickly. "When do you go off duty?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. "If what you want
to ask about is&mdash;anything connected with the management
of things here&mdash;you know we're not supposed to
talk of our patients outside of the hospital."</p>

<p>"I know. But I am going to ask you to break
through the rule&mdash;in that poor fellow's behalf."</p>

<p>A protest wavered on her lip, but he held her eyes
steadily, with a glint of good-humour behind his determination.
"When do you go off duty?"</p>

<p>"At six."</p>

<p>"I'll wait at the corner of South Street and walk
a little way with you. Let me put my case, and if
you're not convinced you can refuse to answer."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, without farther hesitation;
and Amherst, with a slight nod of farewell, passed
through the door near which they had been standing.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Justine Brent emerged from the Hope
Hospital the October dusk had fallen and the
wide suburban street was almost dark, except when
the illuminated bulk of an electric car flashed by under
the maples.</p>

<p>She crossed the tracks and approached the narrower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[p 8]</a></span>
thoroughfare where Amherst awaited her. He hung
back a moment, and she was amused to see that he
failed to identify the uniformed nurse with the girl in
her trim dark dress, soberly complete in all its accessories,
who advanced to him, smiling under her little veil.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said as he turned and walked beside
her. "Is this your way?"</p>

<p>"I am staying in Oak Street. But it's just as short
to go by Maplewood Avenue."</p>

<p>"Yes; and quieter."</p>

<p>For a few yards they walked on in silence, their long
steps falling naturally into time, though Amherst was
somewhat taller than his companion.</p>

<p>At length he said: "I suppose you know nothing
about the relation between Hope Hospital and the
Westmore Mills."</p>

<p>"Only that the hospital was endowed by one of the
Westmore family."</p>

<p>"Yes; an old Miss Hope, a great-aunt of Westmore's.
But there is more than that between them&mdash;all
kinds of subterranean passages." He paused, and
began again: "For instance, Dr. Disbrow married the
sister of our manager's wife."</p>

<p>"Your chief at the mills?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with a slight grimace. "So you see,
if Truscomb&mdash;the manager&mdash;thinks one of the mill-hands
is only slightly injured, it's natural that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[p 9]</a></span>
brother-in-law, Dr. Disbrow, should take an optimistic
view of the case."</p>

<p>"Natural? I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's natural that a man should be
influenced by his wife?"</p>

<p>"Not where his professional honour is concerned."</p>

<p>Amherst smiled. "That sounds very young&mdash;if
you'll excuse my saying so. Well, I won't go on to
insinuate that, Truscomb being high in favour with
the Westmores, and the Westmores having a lien on
the hospital, Disbrow's position there is also bound up
with his taking&mdash;more or less&mdash;the same view as Truscomb's."</p>

<p>Miss Brent had paused abruptly on the deserted
pavement.</p>

<p>"No, don't go on&mdash;if you want me to think well of
you," she flashed out.</p>

<p>Amherst met the thrust composedly, perceiving, as
she turned to face him, that what she resented was not
so much his insinuation against his superiors as his
allusion to the youthfulness of her sentiments. She
was, in fact, as he now noticed, still young enough to
dislike being excused for her youth. In her severe
uniform of blue linen, her dusky skin darkened by the
nurse's cap, and by the pale background of the hospital
walls, she had seemed older, more competent and
experienced; but he now saw how fresh was the pale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[p 10]</a></span>
curve of her cheek, and how smooth the brow clasped
in close waves of hair.</p>

<p>"I began at the wrong end," he acknowledged.
"But let me put Dillon's case before you dismiss me."</p>

<p>She softened. "It is only because of my interest in
that poor fellow that I am here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because you think he needs help&mdash;and that you
can help him?"</p>

<p>But she held back once more. "Please tell me about
him first," she said, walking on.</p>

<p>Amherst met the request with another question.
"I wonder how much you know about factory life?"</p>

<p>"Oh, next to nothing. Just what I've managed to
pick up in these two days at the hospital."</p>

<p>He glanced at her small determined profile under its
dark roll of hair, and said, half to himself: "That
might be a good deal."</p>

<p>She took no notice of this, and he went on: "Well,
I won't try to put the general situation before you,
though Dillon's accident is really the result of it. He
works in the carding room, and on the day of the accident
his 'card' stopped suddenly, and he put his hand
behind him to get a tool he needed out of his trouser-pocket.
He reached back a little too far, and the card
behind him caught his hand in its million of diamond-pointed
wires. Truscomb and the overseer of the room
maintain that the accident was due to his own care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[p 11]</a></span>lessness;
but the hands say that it was caused by the
fact of the cards being too near together, and that just
such an accident was bound to happen sooner or later."</p>

<p>Miss Brent drew an eager breath. "And what do
<i>you</i> say?"</p>

<p>"That they're right: the carding-room is shamefully
overcrowded. Dillon hasn't been in it long&mdash;he
worked his way up at the mills from being a bobbin-boy&mdash;and
he hadn't yet learned how cautious a man
must be in there. The cards are so close to each other
that even the old hands run narrow risks, and it takes
the cleverest operative some time to learn that he must
calculate every movement to a fraction of an inch."</p>

<p>"But why do they crowd the rooms in that way?"</p>

<p>"To get the maximum of profit out of the minimum
of floor-space. It costs more to increase the floor-space
than to maim an operative now and then."</p>

<p>"I see. Go on," she murmured.</p>

<p>"That's the first point; here is the second. Dr.
Disbrow told Truscomb this morning that Dillon's
hand would certainly be saved, and that he might get
back to work in a couple of months if the company
would present him with an artificial finger or two."</p>

<p>Miss Brent faced him with a flush of indignation.
"Mr. Amherst&mdash;who gave you this version of Dr. Disbrow's
report?"</p>

<p>"The manager himself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[p 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Verbally?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he showed me Disbrow's letter."</p>

<p>For a moment or two they walked on silently through
the quiet street; then she said, in a voice still stirred
with feeling: "As I told you this afternoon, Dr. Disbrow
has said nothing in my hearing."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Ogan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Ogan&mdash;" Her voice broke in a ripple of
irony. "Mrs. Ogan 'feels it to be such a beautiful
dispensation, my dear, that, owing to a death that very
morning in the surgical ward, we happened to have a
bed ready for the poor man within three hours of the
accident.'" She had exchanged her deep throat-tones
for a high reedy note which perfectly simulated the
matron's lady-like inflections.</p>

<p>Amherst, at the change, turned on her with a boyish
burst of laughter: she joined in it, and for a moment
they were blent in that closest of unions, the discovery
of a common fund of humour.</p>

<p>She was the first to grow grave. "That three hours'
delay didn't help matters&mdash;how is it there is no emergency
hospital at the mills?"</p>

<p>Amherst laughed again, but in a different key.
"That's part of the larger question, which we haven't
time for now." He waited a moment, and then added:
"You've not yet given me your own impression of
Dillon's case."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[p 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall have it, if you saw that letter. Dillon
will certainly lose his hand&mdash;and probably the whole
arm." She spoke with a thrilling of her slight frame
that transformed the dispassionate professional into a
girl shaken with indignant pity.</p>

<p>Amherst stood still before her. "Good God! Never
anything but useless lumber?"</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he won't die?"</p>

<p>"Alas!"</p>

<p>"He has a consumptive wife and three children.
She ruined her health swallowing cotton-dust at the
factory," Amherst continued.</p>

<p>"So she told me yesterday."</p>

<p>He turned in surprise. "You've had a talk with her?"</p>

<p>"I went out to Westmore last night. I was haunted
by her face when she came to the hospital. She looks
forty, but she told me she was only twenty-six." Miss
Brent paused to steady her voice. "It's the curse of
my trade that it's always tempting me to interfere in
cases where I can do no possible good. The fact is,
I'm not fit to be a nurse&mdash;I shall live and die a wretched
sentimentalist!" she ended, with an angry dash at the
tears on her veil.</p>

<p>Her companion walked on in silence till she had
regained her composure. Then he said: "What did you
think of Westmore?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[p 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it's one of the worst places I ever saw&mdash;and
I am not unused to slums. It looks so dead. The
slums of big cities are much more cheerful."</p>

<p>He made no answer, and after a moment she asked:
"Does the cotton-dust always affect the lungs?"</p>

<p>"It's likely to, where there is the least phthisical tendency.
But of course the harm could be immensely
reduced by taking up the old rough floors which hold
the dust, and by thorough cleanliness and ventilation."</p>

<p>"What does the company do in such cases? Where
an operative breaks down at twenty-five?"</p>

<p>"The company says there was a phthisical tendency."</p>

<p>"And will they give nothing in return for the two
lives they have taken?"</p>

<p>"They will probably pay for Dillon's care at the
hospital, and they have taken the wife back as a
scrubber."</p>

<p>"To clean those uncleanable floors? She's not fit
for it!"</p>

<p>"She must work, fit for it or not; and there is less
strain in scrubbing than in bending over the looms or
cards. The pay is lower, of course, but she's very
grateful for being taken back at all, now that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he's'">she's</ins> no
longer a first-class worker."</p>

<p>Miss Brent's face glowed with a fine wrath. "She
can't possibly stand more than two or three months of
it without breaking down!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[p 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you see they've told her that in less than that
time her husband will be at work again."</p>

<p>"And what will the company do for them when the
wife is a hopeless invalid, and the husband a cripple?"</p>

<p>Amherst again uttered the dry laugh with which he
had met her suggestion of an emergency hospital. "I
know what I should do if I could get anywhere near
Dillon&mdash;give him an overdose of morphine, and let the
widow collect his life-insurance, and make a fresh start."</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously. "Should you, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"If I saw the suffering as you see it, and knew the
circumstances as I know them, I believe I should feel
justified&mdash;" He broke off. "In your work, don't you
ever feel tempted to set a poor devil free?"</p>

<p>She mused. "One might...but perhaps the professional
instinct to save would always come first."</p>

<p>"To save&mdash;what? When all the good of life is
gone?"</p>

<p>"I daresay," she sighed, "poor Dillon would do it
himself if he could&mdash;when he realizes that all the good
<i>is</i> gone."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he can't do it himself; and it's the irony
of such cases that his employers, after ruining his life,
will do all they can to patch up the ruins."</p>

<p>"But that at least ought to count in their favour."</p>

<p>"Perhaps; if&mdash;" He paused, as though reluctant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[p 16]</a></span>
to lay himself open once more to the charge of uncharitableness;
and suddenly she exclaimed, looking
about her: "I didn't notice we had walked so far down
Maplewood Avenue!"</p>

<p>They had turned a few minutes previously into the
wide thoroughfare crowning the high ground which is
covered by the residential quarter of Hanaford. Here
the spacious houses, withdrawn behind shrubberies and
lawns, revealed in their silhouettes every form of architectural
experiment, from the symmetrical pre-Revolutionary
structure, with its classic portico and clipped
box-borders, to the latest outbreak in boulders and
Moorish tiles.</p>

<p>Amherst followed his companion's glance with surprise.
"We <i>have</i> gone a block or two out of our way.
I always forget where I am when I'm talking about
anything that interests me."</p>

<p>Miss Brent looked at her watch. "My friends don't
dine till seven, and I can get home in time by taking a
Grove Street car," she said.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind walking a little farther you can
take a Liberty Street car instead. They run oftener,
and you will get home just as soon."</p>

<p>She made a gesture of assent, and as they walked on
he continued: "I haven't yet explained why I am so
anxious to get an unbiassed opinion of Dillon's case."</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. "What you've told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[p 17]</a></span>
me about Dr. Disbrow and your manager is surely
enough."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly, considering that I am Truscomb's
subordinate. I shouldn't have committed a breach of
professional etiquette, or asked you to do so, if I hadn't
a hope of bettering things; but I have, and that is why
I've held on at Westmore for the last few months, instead
of getting out of it altogether."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"The owner of the mills&mdash;young Richard Westmore&mdash;died
last winter," he went on, "and my hope&mdash;it's
no more&mdash;is that the new broom may sweep a little
cleaner."</p>

<p>"Who is the new broom?"</p>

<p>"Westmore left everything to his widow, and she is
coming here to-morrow to look into the management of
the mills."</p>

<p>"Coming? She doesn't live here, then?"</p>

<p>"At Hanaford? Heaven forbid! It's an anomaly
nowadays for the employer to live near the employed.
The Westmores have always lived in New York&mdash;and
I believe they have a big place on Long Island."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate she <i>is</i> coming, and that ought to
be a good sign. Did she never show any interest in
the mills during her husband's life?"</p>

<p>"Not as far as I know. I've been at Westmore
three years, and she's not been seen there in my time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[p 18]</a></span>
She is very young, and Westmore himself didn't care.
It was a case of inherited money. He drew the dividends,
and Truscomb did the rest."</p>

<p>Miss Brent reflected. "I don't know much about
the constitution of companies&mdash;but I suppose Mrs.
Westmore doesn't unite all the offices in her own person.
Is there no one to stand between Truscomb and
the operatives?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the company, on paper, shows the usual official
hierarchy. Richard Westmore, of course, was president,
and since his death the former treasurer&mdash;Halford
Gaines&mdash;has replaced him, and his son, Westmore
Gaines, has been appointed treasurer. You can see
by the names that it's all in the family. Halford Gaines
married a Miss Westmore, and represents the clan at
Hanaford&mdash;leads society, and keeps up the social credit
of the name. As treasurer, Mr. Halford Gaines kept
strictly to his special business, and always refused to
interfere between Truscomb and the operatives. As
president he will probably follow the same policy, the
more so as it fits in with his inherited respect for the
<i>status quo</i>, and his blissful ignorance of economics."</p>

<p>"And the new treasurer&mdash;young Gaines? Is there no
hope of his breaking away from the family tradition?"</p>

<p>"Westy Gaines has a better head than his father;
but he hates Hanaford and the mills, and his chief object
in life is to be taken for a New Yorker. So far he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[p 19]</a></span>
hasn't been here much, except for the quarterly meetings,
and his routine work is done by another cousin&mdash;you
perceive that Westmore is a nest of nepotism."</p>

<p>Miss Brent's work among the poor had developed
her interest in social problems, and she followed these
details attentively.</p>

<p>"Well, the outlook is not encouraging, but perhaps
Mrs. Westmore's coming will make a change. I suppose
she has more power than any one."</p>

<p>"She might have, if she chose to exert it, for her
husband was really the whole company. The official
cousins hold only a few shares apiece."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, her visit will open her eyes. Who
knows but poor Dillon's case may help others&mdash;prove a
beautiful dispensation, as Mrs. Ogan would say?"</p>

<p>"It does come terribly pat as an illustration of some
of the abuses I want to have remedied. The difficulty
will be to get the lady's ear. That's her house we're
coming to, by the way."</p>

<p>An electric street-lamp irradiated the leafless trees
and stone gate-posts of the building before them.
Though gardens extended behind it, the house stood
so near the pavement that only two short flights of steps
intervened between the gate-posts and the portico.
Light shone from every window of the pompous rusticated
fa&ccedil;ade&mdash;in the turreted "Tuscan villa" style of
the 'fifties&mdash;and as Miss Brent and Amherst approached,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[p 20]</a></span>
their advance was checked by a group of persons who
were just descending from two carriages at the door.</p>

<p>The lamp-light showed every detail of dress and
countenance in the party, which consisted of two men,
one slightly lame, with a long white moustache and a
distinguished nose, the other short, lean and professional,
and of two ladies and their laden attendants.</p>

<p>"Why, that must be her party arriving!" Miss Brent
exclaimed; and as she spoke the younger of the two
ladies, turning back to her maid, exposed to the glare
of the electric light a fair pale face shadowed by the
projection of her widow's veil.</p>

<p>"Is that Mrs. Westmore?" Miss Brent whispered;
and as Amherst muttered: "I suppose so; I've never
seen her&mdash;&mdash;" she continued excitedly: "She looks so
like&mdash;do you know what her name was before she
married?"</p>

<p>He drew his brows together in a hopeless effort of remembrance.
"I don't know&mdash;I must have heard&mdash;but
I never can recall people's names."</p>

<p>"That's bad, for a leader of men!" she said mockingly,
and he answered, as though touched on a sore
point: "I mean people who don't count. I never
forget an operative's name or face."</p>

<p>"One can never tell who may be going to count,"
she rejoined sententiously.</p>

<p>He dwelt on this in silence while they walked on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[p 21]</a></span>
catching as they passed a glimpse of the red-carpeted
Westmore hall on which the glass doors were just
being closed. At length he roused himself to ask:
"Does Mrs. Westmore look like some one you know?"</p>

<p>"I fancied so&mdash;a girl who was at the Sacred Heart
in Paris with me. But isn't this my corner?" she exclaimed,
as they turned into another street, down which
a laden car was descending.</p>

<p>Its approach left them time for no more than a
hurried hand-clasp, and when Miss Brent had been
absorbed into the packed interior her companion, as
his habit was, stood for a while where she had left him,
gazing at some indefinite point in space; then, waking
to a sudden consciousness of his surroundings, he
walked off toward the centre of the town.</p>

<p>At the junction of two business streets he met an
empty car marked "Westmore," and springing into it,
seated himself in a corner and drew out a pocket Shakespeare.
He read on, indifferent to his surroundings,
till the car left the asphalt streets and illuminated shop-fronts
for a grey intermediate region of mud and
macadam. Then he pocketed his volume and sat
looking out into the gloom.</p>

<p>The houses grew less frequent, with darker gaps of
night between; and the rare street-lamps shone on
cracked pavements, crooked telegraph-poles, hoardings
tapestried with patent-medicine posters, and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[p 22]</a></span>
mean desolation of an American industrial suburb.
Farther on there came a weed-grown field or two, then
a row of operatives' houses, the showy gables of the
"Eldorado" road-house&mdash;the only building in Westmore
on which fresh paint was freely lavished&mdash;then
the company "store," the machine shops and other out-buildings,
the vast forbidding bulk of the factories looming
above the river-bend, and the sudden neatness of the
manager's turf and privet hedges. The scene was so
familiar to Amherst that he had lost the habit of comparison,
and his absorption in the moral and material
needs of the workers sometimes made him forget the
outward setting of their lives. But to-night he recalled
the nurse's comment&mdash;"it looks so dead"&mdash;and the
phrase roused him to a fresh perception of the scene.
With sudden disgust he saw the sordidness of it all&mdash;the
poor monotonous houses, the trampled grass-banks,
the lean dogs prowling in refuse-heaps, the reflection of
a crooked gas-lamp in a stagnant loop of the river; and
he asked himself how it was possible to put any sense
of moral beauty into lives bounded forever by the low
horizon of the factory. There is a fortuitous ugliness
that has life and hope in it: the ugliness of overcrowded
city streets, of the rush and drive of packed activities;
but this out-spread meanness of the suburban working
colony, uncircumscribed by any pressure of surrounding
life, and sunk into blank acceptance of its isolation, its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[p 23]</a></span>
banishment from beauty and variety and surprise,
seemed to Amherst the very negation of hope and life.</p>

<p>"She's right," he mused&mdash;"it's dead&mdash;stone dead:
there isn't a drop of wholesome blood left in it."</p>

<p>The Moosuc River valley, in the hollow of which,
for that river's sake, the Westmore mills had been
planted, lingered in the memory of pre-industrial Hanaford
as the pleasantest suburb of the town. Here, beyond
a region of orchards and farm-houses, several
"leading citizens" had placed, above the river-bank,
their prim wood-cut "residences," with porticoes and
terraced lawns; and from the chief of these, Hopewood,
brought into the Westmore family by the Miss Hope
who had married an earlier Westmore, the grim mill-village
had been carved. The pillared "residences"
had, after this, inevitably fallen to base uses; but the
old house at Hopewood, in its wooded grounds, remained,
neglected but intact, beyond the first bend of
the river, deserted as a dwelling but "held" in anticipation
of rising values, when the inevitable growth of
Westmore should increase the demand for small building
lots. Whenever Amherst's eyes were refreshed by
the hanging foliage above the roofs of Westmore, he
longed to convert the abandoned country-seat into a
park and playground for the mill-hands; but he knew
that the company counted on the gradual sale of Hopewood
as a source of profit. No&mdash;the mill-town would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[p 24]</a></span>
not grow beautiful as it grew larger&mdash;rather, in obedience
to the grim law of industrial prosperity, it would soon
lose its one lingering grace and spread out in unmitigated
ugliness, devouring green fields and shaded
slopes like some insect-plague consuming the land.
The conditions were familiar enough to Amherst; and
their apparent inevitableness mocked the hopes he had
based on Mrs. Westmore's arrival.</p>

<p>"Where every stone is piled on another, through the
whole stupid structure of selfishness and egotism, how
can one be pulled out without making the whole thing
topple? And whatever they're blind to, they always
see that," he mused, reaching up for the strap of the car.</p>

<p>He walked a few yards beyond the manager's house,
and turned down a side street lined with scattered cottages.
Approaching one of these by a gravelled path
he pushed open the door, and entered a sitting-room
where a green-shaded lamp shone pleasantly on bookshelves
and a crowded writing-table.</p>

<p>A brisk little woman in black, laying down the evening
paper as she rose, lifted her hands to his tall
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," he said, stooping to her kiss.</p>

<p>"You're late, John," she smiled back at him, not reproachfully,
but with affection.</p>

<p>She was a wonderfully compact and active creature,
with face so young and hair so white that she looked as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[p 25]</a></span>
unreal as a stage mother till a close view revealed the
fine lines that experience had drawn about her mouth
and eyes. The eyes themselves, brightly black and
glancing, had none of the veiled depths of her son's
gaze. Their look was outward, on a world which had
dealt her hard blows and few favours, but in which her
interest was still fresh, amused and unabated.</p>

<p>Amherst glanced at his watch. "Never mind&mdash;Duplain
will be later still. I had to go into Hanaford,
and he is replacing me at the office."</p>

<p>"So much the better, dear: we can have a minute to
ourselves. Sit down and tell me what kept you."</p>

<p>She picked up her knitting as she spoke, having the
kind of hands that find repose in ceaseless small activities.
Her son could not remember a time when he
had not seen those small hands in motion&mdash;shaping
garments, darning rents, repairing furniture, exploring
the inner economy of clocks. "I make a sort of rag-carpet
of the odd minutes," she had once explained
to a friend who wondered at her turning to her needlework
in the moment's interval between other tasks.</p>

<p>Amherst threw himself wearily into a chair. "I was
trying to find out something about Dillon's case," he
said.</p>

<p>His mother turned a quick glance toward the door,
rose to close it, and reseated herself.</p>

<p>"Well?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[p 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I managed to have a talk with his nurse when she
went off duty this evening."</p>

<p>"The nurse? I wonder you could get her to speak."</p>

<p>"Luckily she's not the regular incumbent, but a
volunteer who happened to be here on a visit. As it
was, I had some difficulty in making her talk&mdash;till I
told her of Disbrow's letter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst lifted her bright glance from the
needles. "He's very bad, then?"</p>

<p>"Hopelessly maimed!"</p>

<p>She shivered and cast down her eyes. "Do you
suppose she really knows?"</p>

<p>"She struck me as quite competent to judge."</p>

<p>"A volunteer, you say, here on a visit? What is her
name?"</p>

<p>He raised his head with a vague look. "I never
thought of asking her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst laughed. "How like you! Did she
say with whom she was staying?"</p>

<p>"I think she said in Oak Street&mdash;but she didn't mention
any name."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst wrinkled her brows thoughtfully. "I
wonder if she's not the thin dark girl I saw the other
day with Mrs. Harry Dressel. Was she tall and rather
handsome?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," murmured Amherst indifferently.
As a rule he was humorously resigned to his mother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[p 27]</a></span>
habit of deserting the general for the particular, and
following some irrelevant thread of association in utter
disregard of the main issue. But to-night, preoccupied
with his subject, and incapable of conceiving how anyone
else could be unaffected by it, he resented her indifference
as a sign of incurable frivolity.</p>

<p>"How she can live close to such suffering and forget
it!" was his thought; then, with a movement of self-reproach,
he remembered that the work flying through
her fingers was to take shape as a garment for one of
the infant Dillons. "She takes her pity out in action,
like that quiet nurse, who was as cool as a drum-major
till she took off her uniform&mdash;and then!" His face
softened at the recollection of the girl's outbreak.
Much as he admired, in theory, the woman who kept
a calm exterior in emergencies, he had all a man's
desire to know that the springs of feeling lay close to
the unruffled surface.</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst had risen and crossed over to his chair.
She leaned on it a moment, pushing the tossed brown
hair from his forehead.</p>

<p>"John, have you considered what you mean to do next?"</p>

<p>He threw back his head to meet her gaze.</p>

<p>"About this Dillon case," she continued. "How
are all these investigations going to help you?"</p>

<p>Their eyes rested on each other for a moment; then he
said coldly: "You are afraid I am going to lose my place."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[p 28]</a></span></p>

<p>She flushed like a girl and murmured: "It's not the
kind of place I ever wanted to see you in!"</p>

<p>"I know it," he returned in a gentler tone, clasping
one of the hands on his chair-back. "I ought to have
followed a profession, like my grandfather; but my
father's blood was too strong in me. I should never
have been content as anything but a working-man."</p>

<p>"How can you call your father a working-man? He
had a genius for mechanics, and if he had lived he would
have been as great in his way as any statesman or lawyer."</p>

<p>Amherst smiled. "Greater, to my thinking; but
he gave me his hard-working hands without the genius
to create with them. I wish I had inherited more from
him, or less; but I must make the best of what I am,
rather than try to be somebody else." He laid her
hand caressingly against his cheek. "It's hard on you,
mother&mdash;but you must bear with me."</p>

<p>"I have never complained, John; but now you've
chosen your work, it's natural that I should want you
to stick to it."</p>

<p>He rose with an impatient gesture. "Never fear; I
could easily get another job&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? If Truscomb black-listed you? Do you forget
that Scotch overseer who was here when we came?"</p>

<p>"And whom Truscomb hounded out of the trade?
I remember him," said Amherst grimly; "but I have
an idea I am going to do the hounding this time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[p 29]</a></span></p>

<p>His mother sighed, but her reply was cut short by
the noisy opening of the outer door. Amherst seemed
to hear the sound with relief. "There's Duplain," he
said, going into the passage; but on the threshold he
encountered, not the young Alsatian overseer who
boarded with them, but a small boy who said breathlessly:
"Mr. Truscomb wants you to come down
bimeby."</p>

<p>"This evening? To the office?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he's sick a-bed."</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Amherst's face, and he had to
press his lips close to check an exclamation. "Say
I'll come as soon as I've had supper," he said.</p>

<p>The boy vanished, and Amherst turned back to the
sitting-room. "Truscomb's ill&mdash;he has sent for me;
and I saw Mrs. Westmore arriving tonight! Have
supper, mother&mdash;we won't wait for Duplain." His
face still glowed with excitement, and his eyes were
dark with the concentration of his inward vision.</p>

<p>"Oh, John, John!" Mrs. Amherst sighed, crossing
the passage to the kitchen.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the manager's door Amherst was met by Mrs.
Truscomb, a large flushed woman in a soiled
wrapper and diamond earrings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[p 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Truscomb's very sick. He ought not to see
you. The doctor thinks&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>Dr. Disbrow, at this point, emerged from the sitting-room.
He was a pale man, with a beard of mixed
grey-and-drab, and a voice of the same indeterminate
quality.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Amherst. Truscomb is pretty
poorly&mdash;on the edge of pneumonia, I'm afraid. As he
seems anxious to see you I think you'd better go up for
two minutes&mdash;not more, please." He paused, and
went on with a smile: "You won't excite him, of course&mdash;nothing
unpleasant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's worried himself sick over that wretched Dillon,"
Mrs. Truscomb interposed, draping her wrapper
majestically about an indignant bosom.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;puts too much heart into his work. But
we'll have Dillon all right before long," the physician
genially declared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truscomb, with a reluctant gesture, led Amherst
up the handsomely carpeted stairs to the room
where her husband lay, a prey to the cares of office.
She ushered the young man in, and withdrew to the
next room, where he heard her coughing at intervals,
as if to remind him that he was under observation.</p>

<p>The manager of the Westmore mills was not the
type of man that Amherst's comments on his superior
suggested. As he sat propped against the pillows,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[p 31]</a></span>
with a brick-red flush on his cheek-bones, he seemed
at first glance to belong to the innumerable army of
American business men&mdash;the sallow, undersized, lacklustre
drudges who have never lifted their heads from
the ledger. Even his eye, now bright with fever, was
dull and non-committal in daily life; and perhaps only
the ramifications of his wrinkles could have revealed
what particular ambitions had seamed his soul.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Amherst. I'm down with a confounded
cold."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear it," the young man forced himself
to say.</p>

<p>"Can't get my breath&mdash;that's the trouble." Truscomb
paused and gasped. "I've just heard that Mrs.
Westmore is here&mdash;and I want you to go round&mdash;tomorrow
morning&mdash;" He had to break off once more.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Amherst, his heart leaping.</p>

<p>"Needn't see her&mdash;ask for her father, Mr. Langhope.
Tell him what the doctor says&mdash;I'll be on my legs in a
day or two&mdash;ask 'em to wait till I can take 'em over the
mills."</p>

<p>He shot one of his fugitive glances at his assistant,
and held up a bony hand. "Wait a minute. On your
way there, stop and notify Mr. Gaines. He was to
meet them here. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Amherst; and at that moment Mrs.
Truscomb appeared on the threshold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[p 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must ask you to come now, Mr. Amherst," she
began haughtily; but a glance from her husband reduced
her to a heaving pink nonentity.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Amherst. I hear you've been in to Hanaford.
Did you go to the hospital?"</p>

<p>"Ezra&mdash;" his wife murmured: he looked through her.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Amherst.</p>

<p>Truscomb's face seemed to grow smaller and dryer.
He transferred his look from his wife to his assistant.</p>

<p>"All right. You'll just bear in mind that it's Disbrow's
business to report Dillon's case to Mrs. Westmore?
You're to confine yourself to my message. Is
that clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly clear. Goodnight," Amherst answered,
as he turned to follow Mrs. Truscomb.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That same evening, four persons were seated under
the bronze chandelier in the red satin drawing-room
of the Westmore mansion. One of the four, the young
lady in widow's weeds whose face had arrested Miss
Brent's attention that afternoon, rose from a massively
upholstered sofa and drifted over to the fireplace near
which her father sat.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you it was awful, father?" she sighed,
leaning despondently against the high carved mantelpiece
surmounted by a bronze clock in the form of an
obelisk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[p 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Langhope, who sat smoking, with one faultlessly-clad
leg crossed on the other, and his ebony stick
reposing against the arm of his chair, raised his clear
ironical eyes to her face.</p>

<p>"As an arch&aelig;ologist," he said, with a comprehensive
wave of his hand, "I find it positively interesting. I
should really like to come here and dig."</p>

<p>There were no lamps in the room, and the numerous
gas-jets of the chandelier shed their lights impartially
on ponderously framed canvases of the Bay of Naples
and the Hudson in Autumn, on Carrara busts and
bronze Indians on velvet pedestals.</p>

<p>"All this," murmured Mr. Langhope, "is getting to
be as rare as the giant sequoias. In another fifty years
we shall have collectors fighting for that Bay of Naples."</p>

<p>Bessy Westmore turned from him impatiently. When
she felt deeply on any subject her father's flippancy
annoyed her.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> can see, Maria," she said, seating herself beside
the other lady of the party, "why I couldn't possibly
live here."</p>

<p>Mrs. Eustace Ansell, immediately after dinner, had
bent her slender back above the velvet-covered writing-table,
where an inkstand of Vienna ormolu offered its
empty cup to her pen. Being habitually charged with
a voluminous correspondence, she had foreseen this
contingency and met it by despatching her maid for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[p 34]</a></span>
her own writing-case, which was now outspread before
her in all its complex neatness; but at Bessy's appeal
she wiped her pen, and turned a sympathetic gaze on
her companion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell's face drew all its charm from its adaptability.
It was a different face to each speaker: now
kindling with irony, now gently maternal, now charged
with abstract meditation&mdash;and few paused to reflect
that, in each case, it was merely the mirror held up to
some one else's view of life.</p>

<p>"It needs doing over," she admitted, following the
widow's melancholy glance about the room. "But you
are a spoilt child to complain. Think of having a
house of your own to come to, instead of having to put up
at the Hanaford hotel!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore's attention was arrested by the first
part of the reply.</p>

<p>"Doing over? Why in the world should I do it
over? No one could expect me to come here <i>now</i>&mdash;could
they, Mr. Tredegar?" she exclaimed, transferring
her appeal to the fourth member of the party.</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar, the family lawyer, who had deemed it
his duty to accompany the widow on her visit of inspection,
was strolling up and down the room with
short pompous steps, a cigar between his lips, and his
arms behind him. He cocked his sparrow-like head,
scanned the offending apartment, and terminated his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[p 35]</a></span>
survey by resting his eyes on Mrs. Westmore's charming
petulant face.</p>

<p>"It all depends," he replied axiomatically, "how
large an income you require."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar uttered this remark with the air of
one who pronounces on an important point in law:
his lightest observation seemed a decision handed down
from the bench to which he had never ascended. He
restored the cigar to his lips, and sought approval in
Mrs. Ansell's expressive eye.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it, Bessy. You've that to remember,"
the older lady murmured, as if struck by the profundity
of the remark.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore made an impatient gesture. "We've
always had money enough&mdash;Dick was perfectly satisfied."
Her voice trembled a little on her husband's
name. "And you don't know what the place is like
by daylight&mdash;and the people who come to call!"</p>

<p>"Of course you needn't see any one now, dear," Mrs.
Ansell reminded her, "except the Halford Gaineses."</p>

<p>"I am sure they're bad enough. Juliana Gaines will
say: 'My dear, is that the way widows' veils are worn
in New York this autumn?' and Halford will insist on
our going to one of those awful family dinners, all
Madeira and terrapin."</p>

<p>"It's too early for terrapin," Mrs. Ansell smiled consolingly;
but Bessy had reverted to her argument.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[p 36]</a></span>
"Besides, what difference would my coming here make?
I shall never understand anything about business," she
declared.</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar pondered, and once more removed his
cigar. "The necessity has never arisen. But now
that you find yourself in almost sole control of a large
property&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope laughed gently. "Apply yourself,
Bessy. Bring your masterly intellect to bear on the
industrial problem."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell restored the innumerable implements to
her writing-case, and laid her arm with a caressing
gesture on Mrs. Westmore's shoulder. "Don't tease
her. She's tired, and she misses the baby."</p>

<p>"I shall get a telegram tomorrow morning," exclaimed
the young mother, brightening.</p>

<p>"Of course you will. 'Cicely has just eaten two
boiled eggs and a bowl of porridge, and is bearing up
wonderfully.'"</p>

<p>She drew Mrs. Westmore persuasively to her feet,
but the widow refused to relinquish her hold on her
grievance.</p>

<p>"You all think I'm extravagant and careless about
money," she broke out, addressing the room in general
from the shelter of Mrs. Ansell's embrace; "but
I know one thing: If I had my way I should begin
to economize by selling this horrible house, instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[p 37]</a></span>
of leaving it shut up from one year's end to another."</p>

<p>Her father looked up: proposals of retrenchment
always struck him as business-like when they did not
affect his own expenditure. "What do you think of
that, eh, Tredegar?"</p>

<p>The eminent lawyer drew in his thin lips. "From
the point of view of policy, I think unfavourably of it,"
he pronounced.</p>

<p>Bessy's face clouded, and Mrs. Ansell argued gently:
"Really, it's too late to look so far into the future.
Remember, my dear, that we are due at the mills tomorrow
at ten."</p>

<p>The reminder that she must rise early had the effect
of hastening Mrs. Westmore's withdrawal, and the two
ladies, after an exchange of goodnights, left the men
to their cigars.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Bessy's as hopelessly vague about business as I am,
Tredegar. Why the deuce Westmore left her everything
outright&mdash;but he was only a heedless boy himself."</p>

<p>"Yes. The way he allowed things to go, it's a
wonder there was anything to leave. This Truscomb
must be an able fellow."</p>

<p>"Devoted to Dick's interests, I've always understood."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[p 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"He makes the mills pay well, at any rate, and that's
not so easy nowadays. But on general principles it's
as well he should see that we mean to look into everything
thoroughly. Of course Halford Gaines will never
be more than a good figure-head, but Truscomb must
be made to understand that Mrs. Westmore intends to
interest herself personally in the business."</p>

<p>"Oh, by all means&mdash;of course&mdash;" Mr. Langhope assented,
his light smile stiffening into a yawn at the mere
suggestion.</p>

<p>He rose with an effort, supporting himself on his
stick. "I think I'll turn in myself. There's not a
readable book in that God-forsaken library, and I believe
Maria Ansell has gone off with my volume of
Loti."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next morning, when Amherst presented himself at
the Westmore door, he had decided to follow his chief's
instructions to the letter, and ask for Mr. Langhope
only. The decision had cost him a struggle, for his
heart was big with its purpose; but though he knew
that he must soon place himself in open opposition to
Truscomb, he recognized the prudence of deferring the
declaration of war as long as possible.</p>

<p>On his round of the mills, that morning, he had
paused in the room where Mrs. Dillon knelt beside her
mop and pail, and had found her, to his surprise, com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[p 39]</a></span>paratively
reassured and cheerful. Dr. Disbrow, she
told him, had been in the previous evening, and had
told her to take heart about Jim, and left her enough
money to get along for a week&mdash;and a wonderful new
cough-mixture that he'd put up for her special. Amherst
found it difficult to listen calmly, with the nurse's
words still in his ears, and the sight before him of
Mrs. Dillon's lean shoulder-blades travelling painfully
up and down with the sweep of the mop.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose that cost Truscomb ten dollars,"
he said to himself, as the lift lowered him to the factory
door; but another voice argued that he had no right to
accuse Disbrow of acting as his brother-in-law's agent,
when the gift to Mrs. Dillon might have been prompted
by his own kindness of heart.</p>

<p>"And what prompted the lie about her husband?
Well, perhaps he's an incurable optimist," he summed
up, springing into the Hanaford car.</p>

<p>By the time he reached Mrs. Westmore's door his
wrath had subsided, and he felt that he had himself
well in hand. He had taken unusual pains with his
appearance that morning&mdash;or rather his mother, learning
of the errand on which Truscomb had sent him,
had laid out his carefully-brushed Sunday clothes, and
adjusted his tie with skilful fingers. "You'd really be
handsome, Johnny, if you were only a little vainer,"
she said, pushing him away to survey the result; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[p 40]</a></span>
when he stared at her, repeating: "I never heard that
vanity made a man better-looking," she responded
gaily: "Oh, up to a certain point, because it teaches
him how to use what he's got. So remember," she
charged him, as he smiled and took up his hat, "that
you're going to see a pretty young woman, and that
you're not a hundred years old yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll try to," he answered, humouring her, "but as
I've been forbidden to ask for her, I am afraid your
efforts will be wasted."</p>

<p>The servant to whom he gave his message showed
him into the library, with a request that he should wait;
and there, to his surprise, he found, not the white-moustached
gentleman whom he had guessed the night
before to be Mr. Langhope, but a young lady in deep
black, who turned on him a look of not unfriendly
enquiry.</p>

<p>It was not Bessy's habit to anticipate the clock; but
her distaste for her surroundings, and the impatience
to have done with the tedious duties awaiting her, had
sent her downstairs before the rest of the party. Her
life had been so free from tiresome obligations that she
had but a small stock of patience to meet them with;
and already, after a night at Hanaford, she was pining
to get back to the comforts of her own country-house,
the soft rut of her daily habits, the funny chatter of
her little girl, the long stride of her Irish hunter across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[p 41]</a></span>
the Hempstead plains&mdash;to everything, in short, that
made it conceivably worth while to get up in the
morning.</p>

<p>The servant who ushered in Amherst, thinking the
room empty, had not mentioned his name; and for a
moment he and his hostess examined each other in
silence, Bessy puzzled at the unannounced appearance
of a good-looking young man who might have been
some one she had met and forgotten, while Amherst
felt his self-possession slipping away into the depths of
a pair of eyes so dark-lashed and deeply blue that his
only thought was one of wonder at his previous indifference
to women's eyes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Westmore?" he asked, restored to self-command
by the perception that his longed-for opportunity
was at hand; and Bessy, his voice confirming the inference
she had drawn from his appearance, replied
with a smile: "I am Mrs. Westmore. But if you have
come to see me, I ought to tell you that in a moment I
shall be obliged to go out to our mills. I have a business
appointment with our manager, but if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, gracefully waiting for him to insert his
explanation.</p>

<p>"I have come from the manager; I am John Amherst&mdash;your
assistant manager," he added, as the mention
of his name apparently conveyed no enlightenment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore's face changed, and she let slip a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[p 42]</a></span>
murmur of surprise that would certainly have flattered
Amherst's mother if she could have heard it;
but it had an opposite effect on the young man, who
inwardly accused himself of having tried to disguise
his trade by not putting on his everyday clothes.</p>

<p>"How stupid of me! I took you for&mdash;I had no idea;
I didn't expect Mr. Truscomb here," his employer
faltered in embarrassment; then their eyes met and
both smiled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Truscomb sent me to tell you that he is ill, and
will not be able to show you the mills today. I didn't
mean to ask for you&mdash;I was told to give the message to
Mr. Langhope," Amherst scrupulously explained,
trying to repress the sudden note of joy in his voice.</p>

<p>He was subject to the unobservant man's acute
flashes of vision, and Mrs. Westmore's beauty was like
a blinding light abruptly turned on eyes subdued to
obscurity. As he spoke, his glance passed from her
face to her hair, and remained caught in its meshes.
He had never seen such hair&mdash;it did not seem to grow
in the usual orderly way, but bubbled up all over her
head in independent clusters of brightness, breaking,
about the brow, the temples, the nape, into little irrelevant
waves and eddies of light, with dusky hollows
of softness where the hand might plunge. It takes but
the throb of a nerve to carry such a complex impression
from the eye to the mind, but the object of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[p 43]</a></span>
throb had perhaps felt the electric flash of its passage,
for her colour rose while Amherst spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is my father now," she said with a vague
accent of relief, as Mr. Langhope's stick was heard
tapping its way across the hall.</p>

<p>When he entered, accompanied by Mrs. Ansell, his
sharp glance of surprise at her visitor told her that he
was as much misled as herself, and gave her a sense of
being agreeably justified in her blunder. "If <i>father</i>
thinks you're a gentleman&mdash;&mdash;" her shining eyes seemed
to say, as she explained: "This is Mr. Amherst, father:
Mr. Truscomb has sent him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Amherst?" Langhope, with extended hand,
echoed affably but vaguely; and it became clear that
neither Mrs. Westmore nor her father had ever before
heard the name of their assistant manager.</p>

<p>The discovery stung Amherst to a somewhat unreasoning
resentment; and while he was trying to subordinate
this sentiment to the larger feelings with which
he had entered the house, Mrs. Ansell, turning her
eyes on him, said gently: "Your name is unusual. I
had a friend named Lucy Warne who married a very
clever man&mdash;a mechanical genius&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amherst's face cleared. "My father <i>was</i> a genius;
and my mother is Lucy Warne," he said, won by the
soft look and the persuasive voice.</p>

<p>"What a delightful coincidence! We were girls to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[p 44]</a></span>gether
at Albany. You must remember Judge Warne?"
she said, turning to Mr. Langhope, who, twirling his
white moustache, murmured, a shade less cordially:
"Of course&mdash;of course&mdash;delightful&mdash;most interesting."</p>

<p>Amherst did not notice the difference. His perceptions
were already enveloped in the caress that emanated
from Mrs. Ansell's voice and smile; and he only
asked himself vaguely if it were possible that this graceful
woman, with her sunny autumnal air, could really
be his mother's contemporary. But the question
brought an instant reaction of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Poverty is the only thing that makes people old
nowadays," he reflected, painfully conscious of his own
share in the hardships his mother had endured; and
when Mrs. Ansell went on: "I must go and see her&mdash;you
must let me take her by surprise," he said stiffly:
"We live out at the mills, a long way from here."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're going there this morning," she rejoined,
unrebuffed by what she probably took for a mere
social awkwardness, while Mrs. Westmore interposed:
"But, Maria, Mr. Truscomb is ill, and has sent Mr.
Amherst to say that we are not to come."</p>

<p>"Yes: so Gaines has just telephoned. It's most unfortunate,"
Mr. Langhope grumbled. He too was
already beginning to chafe at the uncongenial exile of
Hanaford, and he shared his daughter's desire to despatch
the tiresome business before them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[p 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar had meanwhile appeared, and when
Amherst had been named to him, and had received his
Olympian nod, Bessy anxiously imparted her difficulty.</p>

<p>"But how ill is Mr. Truscomb? Do you think he
can take us over the mills tomorrow?" she appealed to
Amherst.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not; I am sure he can't. He has a
touch of bronchitis."</p>

<p>This announcement was met by a general outcry,
in which sympathy for the manager was not the predominating
note. Mrs. Ansell saved the situation by
breathing feelingly: "Poor man!" and after a decent
echo of the phrase, and a doubtful glance at her father,
Mrs. Westmore said: "If it's bronchitis he may be
ill for days, and what in the world are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Pack up and come back later," suggested Mr.
Langhope briskly; but while Bessy sighed "Oh, that
dreadful journey!" Mr. Tredegar interposed with authority:
"One moment, Langhope, please. Mr. Amherst,
is Mrs. Westmore expected at the mills?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe they know she is coming."</p>

<p>"Then I think, my dear, that to go back to New
York without showing yourself would, under the circumstances,
be&mdash;er&mdash;an error in judgment."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Tredegar, you don't expect to keep us
kicking our heels here for days?" her father ejaculated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[p 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can certainly not afford to employ mine in that
manner for even a fraction of a day," rejoined the
lawyer, always acutely resentful of the suggestion that
he had a disengaged moment; "but meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father," Bessy interposed, with an eagerly flushing
cheek, "don't you see that the only thing for us to do is to
go over the mills now&mdash;at once&mdash;with Mr. Amherst?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope stared: he was always adventurously
ready to unmake plans, but it flustered him to be called
on to remake them. "Eh&mdash;what? Now&mdash;at once?
But Gaines was to have gone with us, and how on earth
are we to get at him? He telephoned me that, as the
visit was given up, he should ride out to his farm."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind&mdash;or, at least, all the better!" his
daughter urged. "We can see the mills just as well
without him; and we shall get on so much more
quickly."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;what do you say, Tredegar?" murmured
Mr. Langhope, allured by her last argument;
and Bessy, clasping her hands, summed up enthusiastically:
"And I shall understand so much better without
a lot of people trying to explain to me at once!"</p>

<p>Her sudden enthusiasm surprised no one, for even
Mrs. Ansell, expert as she was in the interpreting of
tones, set it down to the natural desire to have done as
quickly as might be with Hanaford.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Westmore has left her little girl at home,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[p 47]</a></span>
she said to Amherst, with a smile intended to counteract
the possible ill-effect of the impression.</p>

<p>But Amherst suspected no slight in his employer's
eagerness to visit Westmore. His overmastering thought
was one of joy as the fulness of his opportunity broke
on him. To show her the mills himself&mdash;to bring her
face to face with her people, unhampered by Truscomb's
jealous vigilance, and Truscomb's false explanations;
to see the angel of pity stir the depths of those unfathomable
eyes, when they rested, perhaps for the
first time, on suffering that it was in their power to
smile away as easily as they had smiled away his own
distrust&mdash;all this the wonderful moment had brought
him, and thoughts and arguments thronged so hot on
his lips that he kept silence, fearing lest he should say
too much.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">John Amherst</span> was no one-sided idealist. He
felt keenly the growing complexity of the relation
between employer and worker, the seeming hopelessness
of permanently harmonizing their claims, the recurring
necessity of fresh compromises and adjustments.
He hated rant, demagogy, the rash formulating
of emotional theories; and his contempt for bad logic
and subjective judgments led him to regard with distrust
the panaceas offered for the cure of economic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[p 48]</a></span>
evils. But his heart ached for the bitter throes with
which the human machine moves on. He felt the
menace of industrial conditions when viewed collectively,
their poignancy when studied in the individual
lives of the toilers among whom his lot was cast; and
clearly as he saw the need of a philosophic survey of
the question, he was sure that only through sympathy
with its personal, human side could a solution be
reached. The disappearance of the old familiar contact
between master and man seemed to him one of the
great wrongs of the new industrial situation. That the
breach must be farther widened by the ultimate substitution
of the stock-company for the individual employer&mdash;a
fact obvious to any student of economic tendencies&mdash;presented
to Amherst's mind one of the most
painful problems in the scheme of social readjustment.
But it was characteristic of him to dwell rather on the
removal of immediate difficulties than in the contemplation
of those to come, and while the individual employer
was still to be reckoned with, the main thing
was to bring him closer to his workers. Till he entered
personally into their hardships and aspirations&mdash;till he
learned what they wanted and why they wanted it&mdash;Amherst
believed that no mere law-making, however
enlightened, could create a wholesome relation between
the two.</p>

<p>This feeling was uppermost as he sat with Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[p 49]</a></span>
Westmore in the carriage which was carrying them to
the mills. He had meant to take the trolley back to
Westmore, but at a murmured word from Mr. Tredegar
Bessy had offered him a seat at her side, leaving
others to follow. This culmination of his hopes&mdash;the
unlooked-for chance of a half-hour alone with her&mdash;left
Amherst oppressed with the swiftness of the
minutes. He had so much to say&mdash;so much to prepare
her for&mdash;yet how begin, while he was in utter ignorance
of her character and her point of view, and while
her lovely nearness left him so little chance of perceiving
anything except itself?</p>

<p>But he was not often the victim of his sensations, and
presently there emerged, out of the very consciousness
of her grace and her completeness, a clearer sense of
the conditions which, in a measure, had gone to produce
them. Her dress could not have hung in such
subtle folds, her white chin have nestled in such rich
depths of fur, the pearls in her ears have given back the
light from such pure curves, if thin shoulders in shapeless
gingham had not bent, day in, day out, above the
bobbins and carders, and weary ears throbbed even at
night with the tumult of the looms. Amherst, however,
felt no sensational resentment at the contrast. He
had lived too much with ugliness and want not to believe
in human nature's abiding need of their opposite.
He was glad there was room for such beauty in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[p 50]</a></span>
the world, and sure that its purpose was an ameliorating
one, if only it could be used as a beautiful spirit would
use it.</p>

<p>The carriage had turned into one of the nondescript
thoroughfares, half incipient street, half decaying lane,
which dismally linked the mill-village to Hanaford.
Bessy looked out on the ruts, the hoardings, the starved
trees dangling their palsied leaves in the radiant October
light; then she sighed: "What a good day for a
gallop!"</p>

<p>Amherst felt a momentary chill, but the naturalness
of the exclamation disarmed him, and the words called
up thrilling memories of his own college days, when he
had ridden his grandfather's horses in the famous
hunting valley not a hundred miles from Hanaford.</p>

<p>Bessy met his smile with a glow of understanding.
"You like riding too, I'm sure?"</p>

<p>"I used to; but I haven't been in the saddle for
years. Factory managers don't keep hunters," he said
laughing.</p>

<p>Her murmur of embarrassment showed that she took
this as an apologetic allusion to his reduced condition,
and in his haste to correct this impression he added:
"If I regretted anything in my other life, it would certainly
be a gallop on a day like this; but I chose my
trade deliberately, and I've never been sorry for my
choice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[p 51]</a></span></p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when he felt the inappropriateness
of this avowal; but her prompt response showed
him, a moment later, that it was, after all, the straightest
way to his end.</p>

<p>"You find the work interesting? I'm sure it must
be. You'll think me very ignorant&mdash;my husband and
I came here so seldom...I feel as if I ought to
know so much more about it," she explained.</p>

<p>At last the note for which he waited had been struck.
"Won't you try to&mdash;now you're here? There's so
much worth knowing," he broke out impetuously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore coloured, but rather with surprise
than displeasure. "I'm very stupid&mdash;I've no head for
business&mdash;but I will try to," she said.</p>

<p>"It's not business that I mean; it's the personal
relation&mdash;just the thing the business point of view
leaves out. Financially, I don't suppose your mills
could be better run; but there are over seven hundred
women working in them, and there's so much to be
done, just for them and their children."</p>

<p>He caught a faint hint of withdrawal in her tone.
"I have always understood that Mr. Truscomb did
everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amherst flushed; but he was beyond caring for the
personal rebuff. "Do you leave it to your little girl's
nurses to do everything for her?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her surprise seemed about to verge on annoyance:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[p 52]</a></span>
he saw the preliminary ruffling of the woman who is
put to the trouble of defending her dignity. "Really,
I don't see&mdash;" she began with distant politeness; then
her face changed and melted, and again her blood
spoke for her before her lips.</p>

<p>"I am glad you told me that, Mr. Amherst. Of
course I want to do whatever I can. I should like you
to point out everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amherst's resolve had been taken while she spoke.
He <i>would</i> point out everything, would stretch his opportunity
to its limit. All thoughts of personal prudence
were flung to the winds&mdash;her blush and tone had
routed the waiting policy. He would declare war on
Truscomb at once, and take the chance of dismissal.
At least, before he went he would have brought this
exquisite creature face to face with the wrongs from
which her luxuries were drawn, and set in motion the
regenerating impulses of indignation and pity. He did
not stop to weigh the permanent advantage of this
course. His only feeling was that the chance would
never again be given him&mdash;that if he let her go away,
back to her usual life, with eyes unopened and heart
untouched, there would be no hope of her ever returning.
It was far better that he should leave for good,
and that she should come back, as come back she
must, more and more often, if once she could be made
to feel the crying need of her presence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[p 53]</a></span></p>

<p>But where was he to begin? How give her even a
glimpse of the packed and intricate situation?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Westmore," he said, "there's no time to
say much now, but before we get to the mills I want
to ask you a favour. If, as you go through them, you
see anything that seems to need explaining, will you
let me come and tell you about it tonight? I say tonight,"
he added, meeting her look of enquiry, "because
later&mdash;tomorrow even&mdash;I might not have the
chance. There are some things&mdash;a good many&mdash;in
the management of the mills that Mr. Truscomb
doesn't see as I do. I don't mean business questions:
wages and dividends and so on&mdash;those are out of my
province. I speak merely in the line of my own work&mdash;my
care of the hands, and what I believe they need
and don't get under the present system. Naturally, if
Mr. Truscomb were well, I shouldn't have had this
chance of putting the case to you; but since it's come
my way, I must seize it and take the consequences."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, by a swift reaction of thought,
those consequences rose before him in all their seriousness.
It was not only, or chiefly, that he feared to lose
his place; though he knew his mother had not spoken
lightly in instancing the case of the foreman whom
Truscomb, to gratify a personal spite, had for months
kept out of a job in his trade. And there were special
reasons why Amherst should heed her warning. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[p 54]</a></span>
adopting a manual trade, instead of one of the gentlemanly
professions which the men of her family had
always followed, he had not only disappointed her
hopes, and to a great extent thrown away the benefits
of the education she had pinched herself to give him,
but had disturbed all the habits of her life by removing
her from her normal surroundings to the depressing
exile of a factory-settlement. However much he
blamed himself for exacting this sacrifice, it had been
made so cheerfully that the consciousness of it never
clouded his life with his mother; but her self-effacement
made him the more alive to his own obligations,
and having placed her in a difficult situation he had
always been careful not to increase its difficulties by
any imprudence in his conduct toward his employers.
Yet, grave as these considerations were, they were
really less potent than his personal desire to remain at
Westmore. Lightly as he had just resolved to risk the
chance of dismissal, all his future was bound up in the
hope of retaining his place. His heart was in the work
at Westmore, and the fear of not being able to get other
employment was a small factor in his intense desire to
keep his post. What he really wanted was to speak
out, and yet escape the consequences: by some miraculous
reversal of probability to retain his position and
yet effect Truscomb's removal. The idea was so
fantastic that he felt it merely as a quickening of all his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[p 55]</a></span>
activities, a tremendous pressure of will along undetermined
lines. He had no wish to take the manager's
place; but his dream was to see Truscomb superseded
by a man of the new school, in sympathy with the
awakening social movement&mdash;a man sufficiently practical
to "run" the mills successfully, yet imaginative
enough to regard that task as the least of his duties.
He saw the promise of such a man in Louis Duplain,
the overseer who boarded with Mrs. Amherst: a young
fellow of Alsatian extraction, a mill-hand from childhood,
who had worked at his trade in Europe as well
as in America, and who united with more manual skill,
and a greater nearness to the workman's standpoint,
all Amherst's enthusiasm for the experiments in social
betterment that were making in some of the English
and continental factories. His strongest wish was to
see such a man as Duplain in control at Westmore
before he himself turned to the larger work which he
had begun to see before him as the sequel to his factory-training.</p>

<p>All these thoughts swept through him in the instant's
pause before Mrs. Westmore, responding to his last
appeal, said with a graceful eagerness: "Yes, you must
come tonight. I want to hear all you can tell me&mdash;and
if there is anything wrong you must show me how
I can make it better."</p>

<p>"I'll show her, and Truscomb shan't turn me out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[p 56]</a></span>
for it," was the vow he passionately registered as
the carriage drew up at the office-door of the main
building.</p>

<p>How this impossible result was to be achieved he
had no farther time to consider, for in another moment
the rest of the party had entered the factory with
them, and speech was followed up in the roar of the
machinery.</p>

<p>Amherst's zeal for his cause was always quickened
by the sight of the mills in action. He loved the work
itself as much as he hated the conditions under which
it was done; and he longed to see on the operatives'
faces something of the ardour that lit up his own when
he entered the work-rooms. It was this passion for
machinery that at school had turned him from his
books, at college had drawn him to the courses least
in the line of his destined profession; and it always
seized on him afresh when he was face to face with the
monstrous energies of the mills. It was not only the
sense of power that thrilled him&mdash;he felt a beauty in
the ordered activity of the whole intricate organism,
in the rhythm of dancing bobbins and revolving cards,
the swift continuous outpour of doublers and ribbon-laps,
the steady ripple of the long ply-frames, the terrible
gnashing play of the looms&mdash;all these varying
subordinate motions, gathered up into the throb of
the great engines which fed the giant's arteries, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[p 57]</a></span>
were in turn ruled by the invisible action of quick
thought and obedient hands, always produced in Amherst
a responsive rush of life.</p>

<p>He knew this sensation was too specialized to affect
his companions; but he expected Mrs. Westmore to
be all the more alive to the other side&mdash;the dark side of
monotonous human toil, of the banquet of flesh and
blood and brain perpetually served up to the monster
whose insatiable jaws the looms so grimly typified.
Truscomb, as he had told her, was a good manager
from the profit-taking standpoint. Since it was profitable
to keep the machinery in order, he maintained
throughout the factory a high standard of mechanical
supervision, except where one or two favoured overseers&mdash;for
Truscomb was given to favoritism&mdash;shirked
the duties of their departments. But it was of the essence
of Truscomb's policy&mdash;and not the least of the
qualities which made him a "paying" manager&mdash;that
he saved money scrupulously where its outlay would
not have resulted in larger earnings. To keep the
floors scrubbed, the cotton-dust swept up, the rooms
freshly whitewashed and well-ventilated, far from adding
the smallest fraction to the quarterly dividends,
would have deducted from them the slight cost of this
additional labour; and Truscomb therefore economized
on scrubbers, sweepers and window-washers, and on
all expenses connected with improved ventilation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[p 58]</a></span>
other hygienic precautions. Though the whole factory
was over-crowded, the newest buildings were more
carefully planned, and had the usual sanitary improvements;
but the old mills had been left in their original
state, and even those most recently built were fast
lapsing into squalor. It was no wonder, therefore, that
workers imprisoned within such walls should reflect
their long hours of deadening toil in dull eyes and
an&aelig;mic skins, and in the dreary lassitude with which
they bent to their tasks.</p>

<p>Surely, Amherst argued, Mrs. Westmore must feel
this; must feel it all the more keenly, coming from an
atmosphere so different, from a life where, as he instinctively
divined, all was in harmony with her own
graceful person. But a deep disappointment awaited
him. He was still under the spell of their last moments
in the carriage, when her face and voice had promised
so much, when she had seemed so deeply, if vaguely,
stirred by his appeal. But as they passed from one resounding
room to the other&mdash;from the dull throb of the
carding-room, the groan of the ply-frames, the long
steady pound of the slashers, back to the angry shriek
of the fierce unappeasable looms&mdash;the light faded from
her eyes and she looked merely bewildered and stunned.</p>

<p>Amherst, hardened to the din of the factory, could
not measure its effect on nerves accustomed to the
subdued sounds and spacious stillnesses which are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[p 59]</a></span>
last refinement of luxury. Habit had made him unconscious
of that malicious multiplication and subdivision
of noise that kept every point of consciousness
vibrating to a different note, so that while one set of
nerves was torn as with pincers by the dominant scream
of the looms, others were thrilled with a separate pain
by the ceaseless accompaniment of drumming, hissing,
grating and crashing that shook the great building.
Amherst felt this tumult only as part of the atmosphere
of the mills; and to ears trained like his own he could
make his voice heard without difficulty. But his
attempts at speech were unintelligible to Mrs. Westmore
and her companions, and after vainly trying to
communicate with him by signs they hurried on as if
to escape as quickly as possible from the pursuing
whirlwind.</p>

<p>Amherst could not allow for the depressing effect of
this enforced silence. He did not see that if Bessy
could have questioned him the currents of sympathy
might have remained open between them, whereas,
compelled to walk in silence through interminable
ranks of meaningless machines, to which the human
workers seemed mere automatic appendages, she lost
all perception of what the scene meant. He had
forgotten, too, that the swift apprehension of suffering
in others is as much the result of training as the immediate
perception of beauty. Both perceptions may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[p 60]</a></span>
inborn, but if they are not they can be developed only
through the discipline of experience.</p>

<p>"That girl in the hospital would have seen it all,"
he reflected, as the vision of Miss Brent's small incisive
profile rose before him; but the next moment he caught
the light on Mrs. Westmore's hair, as she bent above a
card, and the paler image faded like a late moon in
the sunrise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Ansell, seeing that the detailed inspection
of the buildings was as trying to Mr. Langhope's
lameness as to his daughter's nerves, had proposed
to turn back with him and drive to Mrs. Amherst's,
where he might leave her to call while the
others were completing their rounds. It was one of Mrs.
Ansell's gifts to detect the first symptoms of <i>ennui</i> in her
companions, and produce a remedy as patly as old ladies
whisk out a scent-bottle or a cough-lozenge; and Mr.
Langhope's look of relief showed the timeliness of her
suggestion.</p>

<p>Amherst was too preoccupied to wonder how his
mother would take this visit; but he welcomed Mr.
Langhope's departure, hoping that the withdrawal of
his ironic smile would leave his daughter open to gentler
influences. Mr. Tredegar, meanwhile, was projecting
his dry glance over the scene, trying to converse by
signs with the overseers of the different rooms, and
pausing now and then to contemplate, not so much the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[p 61]</a></span>
workers themselves as the special tasks which engaged
them.</p>

<p>How these spectators of the party's progress were
affected by Mrs. Westmore's appearance, even Amherst,
for all his sympathy with their views, could
not detect. They knew that she was the new owner,
that a disproportionate amount of the result of their
toil would in future pass through her hands, spread
carpets for her steps, and hang a setting of beauty about
her eyes; but the knowledge seemed to produce no
special interest in her personality. A change of employer
was not likely to make any change in their lot:
their welfare would probably continue to depend on
Truscomb's favour. The men hardly raised their
heads as Mrs. Westmore passed; the women stared,
but with curiosity rather than interest; and Amherst
could not tell whether their sullenness reacted on Mrs.
Westmore, or whether they were unconsciously chilled
by her indifference. The result was the same: the
distance between them seemed to increase instead of
diminishing; and he smiled ironically to think of the
form his appeal had taken&mdash;"If you see anything that
seems to need explaining." Why, she saw nothing&mdash;nothing
but the greasy floor under her feet, the cotton-dust
in her eyes, the dizzy incomprehensible whirring
of innumerable belts and wheels! Once out of it all,
she would make haste to forget the dreary scene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[p 62]</a></span>
without pausing to ask for any explanation of its
dreariness.</p>

<p>In the intensity of his disappointment he sought a
pretext to cut short the tour of the buildings, that he
might remove his eyes from the face he had so vainly
watched for any sign of awakening. And then, as he
despaired of it, the change came.</p>

<p>They had entered the principal carding-room, and
were half-way down its long central passage, when Mr.
Tredegar, who led the procession, paused before one
of the cards.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, pointing to a ragged strip
of black cloth tied conspicuously to the frame of the
card.</p>

<p>The overseer of the room, a florid young man with
dissipated eyes, who, at Amherst's signal, had attached
himself to the party, stopped short and turned a furious
glance on the surrounding operatives.</p>

<p>"What in hell...? It's the first I seen of it," he
exclaimed, making an ineffectual attempt to snatch the
mourning emblem from its place.</p>

<p>At the same instant the midday whistle boomed
through the building, and at the signal the machinery
stopped, and silence fell on the mills. The more distant
workers at once left their posts to catch up the
hats and coats heaped untidily in the corners; but
those nearer by, attracted by the commotion around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[p 63]</a></span>
the card, stood spell-bound, fixing the visitors with a
dull stare.</p>

<p>Amherst had reddened to the roots of his hair. He
knew in a flash what the token signified, and the sight
stirred his pity; but it also jarred on his strong sense of
discipline, and he turned sternly to the operatives.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?"</p>

<p>There was a short silence; then one of the hands, a thin
bent man with mystic eyes, raised his head and spoke.</p>

<p>"We done that for Dillon," he said.</p>

<p>Amherst's glance swept the crowded faces. "But
Dillon was not killed," he exclaimed, while the overseer,
drawing out his pen-knife, ripped off the cloth and
tossed it contemptuously into a heap of cotton-refuse
at his feet.</p>

<p>"Might better ha' been," came from another hand;
and a deep "That's so" of corroboration ran through
the knot of workers.</p>

<p>Amherst felt a touch on his arm, and met Mrs. Westmore's
eyes. "What has happened? What do they
mean?" she asked in a startled voice.</p>

<p>"There was an accident here two days ago: a man
got caught in the card behind him, and his right hand
was badly crushed."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar intervened with his dry note of command.
"How serious is the accident? How did it
happen?" he enquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[p 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Through the man's own carelessness&mdash;ask the
manager," the overseer interposed before Amherst
could answer.</p>

<p>A deep murmur of dissent ran through the crowd,
but Amherst, without noticing the overseer's reply,
said to Mr. Tredegar: "He's at the Hope Hospital.
He will lose his hand, and probably the whole arm."</p>

<p>He had not meant to add this last phrase. However
strongly his sympathies were aroused, it was against his
rule, at such a time, to say anything which might inflame
the quick passions of the workers: he had meant
to make light of the accident, and dismiss the operatives
with a sharp word of reproof. But Mrs. Westmore's
face was close to his: he saw the pity in her
eyes, and feared, if he checked its expression, that he
might never again have the chance of calling it forth.</p>

<p>"His right arm? How terrible! But then he will
never be able to work again!" she exclaimed, in all the
horror of a first confrontation with the inexorable fate
of the poor.</p>

<p>Her eyes turned from Amherst and rested on the
faces pressing about her. There were many women's
faces among them&mdash;the faces of fagged middle-age, and
of sallow sedentary girlhood. For the first time Mrs.
Westmore seemed to feel the bond of blood between
herself and these dim creatures of the underworld: as
Amherst watched her the lovely miracle was wrought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[p 65]</a></span>
Her pallour gave way to a quick rush of colour, her
eyes widened like a frightened child's, and two tears
rose and rolled slowly down her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, why wasn't I told? Is he married? Has he
children? What does it matter whose fault it was?"
she cried, her questions pouring out disconnectedly on
a wave of anger and compassion.</p>

<p>"It warn't his fault.... The cards are too close.... It'll
happen again.... He's got three kids at
home," broke from the operatives; and suddenly a
voice exclaimed "Here's his wife now," and the crowd
divided to make way for Mrs. Dillon, who, passing
through the farther end of the room, had been waylaid
and dragged toward the group.</p>

<p>She hung back, shrinking from the murderous machine,
which she beheld for the first time since her
husband's accident; then she saw Amherst, guessed
the identity of the lady at his side, and flushed up to
her haggard forehead. Mrs. Dillon had been good-looking
in her earlier youth, and sufficient prettiness
lingered in her hollow-cheeked face to show how much
more had been sacrificed to sickness and unwholesome
toil.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, ma'am, it warn't Jim's fault&mdash;there
ain't a steadier man living. The cards is too crowded,"
she sobbed out.</p>

<p>Some of the other women began to cry: a wave of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[p 66]</a></span>
sympathy ran through the circle, and Mrs. Westmore
moved forward with an answering exclamation. "You
poor creature...you poor creature...." She opened
her arms to Mrs. Dillon, and the scrubber's sobs were
buried on her employer's breast.</p>

<p>"I will go to the hospital&mdash;I will come and see you&mdash;I
will see that everything is done," Bessy reiterated.
"But why are you here? How is it that you have had
to leave your children?" She freed herself to turn a
reproachful glance on Amherst. "You don't mean to
tell me that, at such a time, you keep the poor woman
at work?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dillon has not been working here lately,"
Amherst answered. "The manager took her back to-day
at her own request, that she might earn something
while her husband was in hospital."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore's eyes shone indignantly. "Earn
something? But surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She met a silencing look from Mr. Tredegar, who had
stepped between Mrs. Dillon and herself.</p>

<p>"My dear child, no one doubts&mdash;none of these good
people doubt&mdash;that you will look into the case, and do
all you can to alleviate it; but let me suggest that this
is hardly the place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned from him with an appealing glance at
Amherst.</p>

<p>"I think," the latter said, as their eyes met, "that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[p 67]</a></span>
you had better let me dismiss the hands: they have
only an hour at midday."</p>

<p>She signed her assent, and he turned to the operatives
and said quietly: "You have heard Mrs. Westmore's
promise; now take yourselves off, and give her
a clear way to the stairs."</p>

<p>They dropped back, and Mr. Tredegar drew Bessy's
arm through his; but as he began to move away she
turned and laid her hand on Mrs. Dillon's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You must not stay here&mdash;you must go back to the
children. I will make it right with Mr. Truscomb,"
she said in a reassuring whisper; then, through her
tears, she smiled a farewell at the lingering knot of
operatives, and followed her companions to the
door.</p>

<p>In silence they descended the many stairs and crossed
the shabby unfenced grass-plot between the mills and
the manager's office. It was not till they reached the
carriage that Mrs. Westmore spoke.</p>

<p>"But Maria is waiting for us&mdash;we must call for her!"
she said, rousing herself; and as Amherst opened the
carriage-door she added: "You will show us the way?
You will drive with us?"</p>

<p>During the drive Bessy remained silent, as if re-absorbed
in the distress of the scene she had just witnessed;
and Amherst found himself automatically answering
Mr. Tredegar's questions, while his own mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[p 68]</a></span>
had no room for anything but the sense of her tremulous
lips and of her eyes enlarged by tears. He had
been too much engrossed in the momentous issues of
her visit to the mills to remember that she had promised
to call at his mother's for Mrs. Ansell; but now
that they were on their way thither he found himself
wishing that the visit might have been avoided. He
was too proud of his mother to feel any doubt of the
impression she would produce; but what would Mrs.
Westmore think of their way of living, of the cheap
jauntiness of the cottage, and the smell of cooking penetrating
all its thin partitions? Duplain, too, would be
coming in for dinner; and Amherst, in spite of his liking
for the young overseer, became conscious of a
rather overbearing freedom in his manner, the kind of
misplaced ease which the new-made American affects
as the readiest sign of equality. All these trifles, usually
non-existent or supremely indifferent to Amherst, now
assumed a sudden importance, behind which he detected
the uneasy desire that Mrs. Westmore should not regard
him as less of her own class than his connections and
his bringing-up entitled him to be thought. In a flash
he saw what he had forfeited by his choice of a calling&mdash;equal
contact with the little circle of people who gave
life its crowning grace and facility; and the next moment
he was blushing at this reversal of his standards,
and wondering, almost contemptuously, what could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[p 69]</a></span>
the nature of the woman whose mere presence could
produce such a change.</p>

<p>But there was no struggling against her influence;
and as, the night before, he had looked at Westmore
with the nurse's eyes, so he now found himself seeing
his house as it must appear to Mrs. Westmore. He
noticed the shabby yellow paint of the palings, the neglected
garden of their neighbour, the week's wash
flaunting itself indecently through the denuded shrubs
about the kitchen porch; and as he admitted his companions
to the narrow passage he was assailed by the
expected whiff of "boiled dinner," with which the steam
of wash-tubs was intimately mingled.</p>

<p>Duplain was in the passage; he had just come out
of the kitchen, and the fact that he had been washing
his hands in the sink was made evident by his rolled-back
shirt-sleeves, and by the shiny redness of the
knuckles he was running through his stiff black hair.</p>

<p>"Hallo, John," he said, in his aggressive voice, which
rose abruptly at sight of Amherst's companions; and
at the same moment the frowsy maid-of-all-work,
crimson from stooping over the kitchen stove, thrust
her head out to call after him: "See here, Mr. Duplain,
don't you leave your cravat laying round in my
dough."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[p 70]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Westmore</span> stayed just long enough not to
break in too abruptly on the flow of her friend's
reminiscences, and to impress herself on Mrs. Amherst's
delighted eyes as an embodiment of tactfulness
and grace&mdash;looking sympathetically about the little
room, which, with its books, its casts, its photographs
of memorable pictures, seemed, after all, a not incongruous
setting to her charms; so that when she rose to
go, saying, as her hand met Amherst's, "Tonight, then,
you must tell me all about those poor Dillons," he had
the sense of having penetrated so far into her intimacy
that a new Westmore must inevitably result from their
next meeting.</p>

<p>"Say, John&mdash;the boss is a looker," Duplain commented
across the dinner-table, with the slangy grossness
he sometimes affected; but Amherst left it to his
mother to look a quiet rebuke, feeling himself too aloof
from such contacts to resent them.</p>

<p>He had to rouse himself with an effort to take in the
overseer's next observation. "There was another lady
at the office this morning," Duplain went on, while the
two men lit their cigars in the porch. "Asking after
you&mdash;tried to get me to show her over the mills when I
said you were busy."</p>

<p>"Asking after me? What did she look like?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[p 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, her face was kinder white and small, with an
awful lot of black hair fitting close to it. Said she came
from Hope Hospital."</p>

<p>Amherst looked up. "Did you show her over?" he
asked with sudden interest.</p>

<p>Duplain laughed slangily. "What? Me? And have
Truscomb get on to it and turn me down? How'd I
know she wasn't a yellow reporter?"</p>

<p>Amherst uttered an impatient exclamation. "I wish
to heaven a yellow reporter <i>would</i> go through these
mills, and show them up in head-lines a yard high!"</p>

<p>He regretted not having seen the nurse again: he
felt sure she would have been interested in the working
of the mills, and quick to notice the signs of discouragement
and ill-health in the workers' faces; but a moment
later his regret was dispelled by the thought
of his visit to Mrs. Westmore. The afternoon hours
dragged slowly by in the office, where he was bound
to his desk by Truscomb's continued absence; but
at length the evening whistle blew, the clerks in the
outer room caught their hats from the rack, Duplain
presented himself with the day's report, and the two
men were free to walk home.</p>

<p>Two hours later Amherst was mounting Mrs. Westmore's
steps; and his hand was on the bell when the
door opened and Dr. Disbrow came out. The physician
drew back, as if surprised and slightly discon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[p 72]</a></span>certed;
but his smile promptly effaced all signs of
vexation, and he held his hand out affably.</p>

<p>"A fine evening, Mr. Amherst. I'm glad to say I
have been able to bring Mrs. Westmore an excellent
report of both patients&mdash;Mr. Truscomb, I mean, and
poor Dillon. This mild weather is all in their favour,
and I hope my brother-in-law will be about in a day or
two." He passed on with a nod.</p>

<p>Amherst was once more shown into the library where
he had found Mrs. Westmore that morning; but on
this occasion it was Mr. Tredegar who rose to meet him, and
curtly waved him to a seat at a respectful distance
from his own. Amherst at once felt a change of atmosphere,
and it was easy to guess that the lowering of
temperature was due to Dr. Disbrow's recent visit.
The thought roused the young man's combative instincts,
and caused him to say, as Mr. Tredegar continued
to survey him in silence from the depths of a
capacious easy-chair: "I understood from Mrs. Westmore
that she wished to see me this evening."</p>

<p>It was the wrong note, and he knew it; but he had
been unable to conceal his sense of the vague current
of opposition in the air.</p>

<p>"Quite so: I believe she asked you to come," Mr.
Tredegar assented, laying his hands together vertically,
and surveying Amherst above the acute angle formed
by his parched finger-tips. As he leaned back, small,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[p 73]</a></span>
dry, dictatorial, in the careless finish of his evening
dress and pearl-studded shirt-front, his appearance put
the finishing touch to Amherst's irritation. He felt the
incongruousness of his rough clothes in this atmosphere
of after-dinner ease, the mud on his walking-boots, the
clinging cotton-dust which seemed to have entered into
the very pores of the skin; and again his annoyance
escaped in his voice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have come too early&mdash;" he began; but
Mr. Tredegar interposed with glacial amenity: "No,
I believe you are exactly on time; but Mrs. Westmore
is unexpectedly detained. The fact is, Mr. and Mrs.
Halford Gaines are dining with her, and she has
delegated to me the duty of hearing what you have to
say."</p>

<p>Amherst hesitated. His impulse was to exclaim:
"There is no duty about it!" but a moment's thought
showed the folly of thus throwing up the game. With
the prospect of Truscomb's being about again in a day
or two, it might well be that this was his last chance
of reaching Mrs. Westmore's ear; and he was bound
to put his case while he could, irrespective of personal
feeling. But his disappointment was too keen to be
denied, and after a pause he said: "Could I not speak
with Mrs. Westmore later?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar's cool survey deepened to a frown.
The young man's importunity was really out of pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[p 74]</a></span>portion
to what he signified. "Mrs. Westmore has
asked me to replace her," he said, putting his previous
statement more concisely.</p>

<p>"Then I am not to see her at all?" Amherst exclaimed;
and the lawyer replied indifferently: "I am
afraid not, as she leaves tomorrow."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar was in his element when refusing a
favour. Not that he was by nature unkind; he was,
indeed, capable of a cold beneficence; but to deny
what it was in his power to accord was the readiest way
of proclaiming his authority, that power of loosing and
binding which made him regard himself as almost consecrated
to his office.</p>

<p>Having sacrificed to this principle, he felt free to add
as a gratuitous concession to politeness: "You are perhaps
not aware that I am Mrs. Westmore's lawyer,
and one of the executors under her husband's will."</p>

<p>He dropped this negligently, as though conscious of
the absurdity of presenting his credentials to a subordinate;
but his manner no longer incensed Amherst:
it merely strengthened his resolve to sink all sense of
affront in the supreme effort of obtaining a hearing.</p>

<p>"With that stuffed canary to advise her," he reflected,
"there's no hope for her unless I can assert myself
now"; and the unconscious wording of his thought
expressed his inward sense that Bessy Westmore stood
in greater need of help than her work-people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[p 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he hesitated, hardly knowing how to begin.
To Mr. Tredegar he was no more than an underling,
without authority to speak in his superior's absence;
and the lack of an official warrant, which he
could have disregarded in appealing to Mrs. Westmore,
made it hard for him to find a good opening in addressing
her representative. He saw, too, from Mr. Tredegar's
protracted silence, that the latter counted on the
effect of this embarrassment, and was resolved not to
minimize it by giving him a lead; and this had the
effect of increasing his caution.</p>

<p>He looked up and met the lawyer's eye. "Mrs.
Westmore," he began, "asked me to let her know
something about the condition of the people at the
mills&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar raised his hand. "Excuse me," he
said. "I understood from Mrs. Westmore that it
was you who asked her permission to call this evening
and set forth certain grievances on the part of the
operatives."</p>

<p>Amherst reddened. "I did ask her&mdash;yes. But I
don't in any sense represent the operatives. I simply
wanted to say a word for them."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar folded his hands again, and crossed
one lean little leg over the other, bringing into his line
of vision the glossy tip of a patent-leather pump, which
he studied for a moment in silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[p 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does Mr. Truscomb know of your intention?" he
then enquired.</p>

<p>"No, sir," Amherst answered energetically, glad that
he had forced the lawyer out of his passive tactics. "I
am here on my own responsibility&mdash;and in direct opposition
to my own interests," he continued with a slight
smile. "I know that my proceeding is quite out of
order, and that I have, personally, everything to lose
by it, and in a larger way probably very little to gain;
but I thought Mrs. Westmore's attention ought to be
called to certain conditions at the mills, and no one
else seemed likely to speak of them."</p>

<p>"May I ask why you assume that Mr. Truscomb
will not do so when he has the opportunity?"</p>

<p>Amherst could not repress a smile. "Because it is
owing to Mr. Truscomb that they exist."</p>

<p>"The real object of your visit then," said Mr. Tredegar,
speaking with deliberation, "is&mdash;er&mdash;an underhand
attack on your manager's methods?"</p>

<p>Amherst's face darkened, but he kept his temper.
"I see nothing especially underhand in my course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except," the other interposed ironically, "that you
have waited to speak till Mr. Truscomb was not in a
position to defend himself."</p>

<p>"I never had the chance before. It was at Mrs.
Westmore's own suggestion that I took her over the
mills, and feeling as I do I should have thought it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[p 77]</a></span>
cowardly to shirk the chance of pointing out to her the
conditions there."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar mused, his eyes still bent on his gently-oscillating
foot. Whenever a sufficient pressure from
without parted the fog of self-complacency in which he
moved, he had a shrewd enough outlook on men and
motives; and it may be that the vigorous ring of Amherst's
answer had effected this momentary clearing of
the air.</p>

<p>At any rate, his next words were spoken in a more
accessible tone. "To what conditions do you refer?"</p>

<p>"To the conditions under which the mill-hands work
and live&mdash;to the whole management of the mills, in
fact, in relation to the people employed."</p>

<p>"That is a large question. Pardon my possible ignorance&mdash;" Mr.
Tredegar paused to make sure that
his hearer took in the full irony of this&mdash;"but surely in
this state there are liability and inspection laws for the
protection of the operatives?"</p>

<p>"There are such laws, yes&mdash;but most of them are
either a dead letter, or else so easily evaded that no
employer thinks of conforming to them."</p>

<p>"No employer? Then your specific charge against
the Westmore mills is part of a general arraignment of
all employers of labour?"</p>

<p>"By no means, sir. I only meant that, where the
hands are well treated, it is due rather to the personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[p 78]</a></span>
good-will of the employer than to any fear of the
law."</p>

<p>"And in what respect do you think the Westmore
hands unfairly treated?"</p>

<p>Amherst paused to measure his words. "The question,
as you say, is a large one," he rejoined. "It has
its roots in the way the business is organized&mdash;in the
traditional attitude of the company toward the operatives.
I hoped that Mrs. Westmore might return to
the mills&mdash;might visit some of the people in their houses.
Seeing their way of living, it might have occurred to her
to ask a reason for it&mdash;and one enquiry would have led
to another. She spoke this morning of going to the
hospital to see Dillon."</p>

<p>"She did go to the hospital: I went with her. But
as Dillon was sleeping, and as the matron told us he
was much better&mdash;a piece of news which, I am happy
to say, Dr. Disbrow has just confirmed&mdash;she did not
go up to the ward."</p>

<p>Amherst was silent, and Mr. Tredegar pursued: "I
gather, from your bringing up Dillon's case, that for
some reason you consider it typical of the defects you
find in Mr. Truscomb's management. Suppose, therefore,
we drop generalizations, and confine ourselves to
the particular instance. What wrong, in your view,
has been done the Dillons?"</p>

<p>He turned, as he spoke, to extract a cigar from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[p 79]</a></span>
box at his elbow. "Let me offer you one, Mr. Amherst:
we shall talk more comfortably," he suggested
with distant affability; but Amherst, with a gesture of
refusal, plunged into his exposition of the Dillon case.
He tried to put the facts succinctly, presenting them in
their bare ugliness, without emotional drapery; setting
forth Dillon's good record for sobriety and skill, dwelling
on the fact that his wife's ill-health was the result
of perfectly remediable conditions in the work-rooms,
and giving his reasons for the belief that the accident
had been caused, not by Dillon's carelessness, but by
the over-crowding of the carding-room. Mr. Tredegar
listened attentively, though the cloud of cigar-smoke
between himself and Amherst masked from the latter
his possible changes of expression. When he removed
his cigar, his face looked smaller than ever, as though
desiccated by the fumes of the tobacco.</p>

<p>"Have you ever called Mr. Gaines's attention to
these matters?"</p>

<p>"No: that would have been useless. He has always
refused to discuss the condition of the mills with any
one but the manager."</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;that would seem to prove that Mr. Gaines,
who lives here, sees as much reason for trusting Truscomb's
judgment as Mr. Westmore, who delegated his
authority from a distance."</p>

<p>Amherst did not take this up, and after a pause Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[p 80]</a></span>
Tredegar went on: "You know, of course, the answers
I might make to such an indictment. As a lawyer, I
might call your attention to the employ&eacute;'s waiver of
risk, to the strong chances of contributory negligence,
and so on; but happily in this case such arguments are
superfluous. You are apparently not aware that Dillon's
injury is much slighter than it ought to be to
serve your purpose. Dr. Disbrow has just told us
that he will probably get off with the loss of a finger;
and I need hardly say that, whatever may have been
Dillon's own share in causing the accident&mdash;and as to
this, as you admit, opinions differ&mdash;Mrs. Westmore
will assume all the expenses of his nursing, besides
making a liberal gift to his wife." Mr. Tredegar laid
down his cigar and drew forth a silver-mounted note-case.
"Here, in fact," he continued, "is a cheque
which she asks you to transmit, and which, as I think
you will agree, ought to silence, on your part as well
as Mrs. Dillon's, any criticism of Mrs. Westmore's
dealings with her operatives."</p>

<p>The blood rose to Amherst's forehead, and he just
restrained himself from pushing back the cheque which
Mr. Tredegar had laid on the table between them.</p>

<p>"There is no question of criticizing Mrs. Westmore's
dealings with her operatives&mdash;as far as I know, she has
had none as yet," he rejoined, unable to control his
voice as completely as his hand. "And the proof of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[p 81]</a></span>
it is the impunity with which her agents deceive her&mdash;in
this case, for instance, of Dillon's injury. Dr. Disbrow,
who is Mr. Truscomb's brother-in-law, and apt
to be influenced by his views, assures you that the man
will get off with the loss of a finger; but some one
equally competent to speak told me last night that he
would lose not only his hand but his arm."</p>

<p>Amherst's voice had swelled to a deep note of anger,
and with his tossed hair, and eyes darkening under furrowed
brows, he presented an image of revolutionary violence
which deepened the disdain on Mr. Tredegar's lip.</p>

<p>"Some one equally competent to speak? Are you
prepared to name this anonymous authority?"</p>

<p>Amherst hesitated. "No&mdash;I shall have to ask you
to take my word for it," he returned with a shade of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" Mr. Tredegar murmured, giving to the expressive
syllable its utmost measure of decent exultation.</p>

<p>Amherst quivered under the thin lash, and broke out:
"It is all you have required of Dr. Disbrow&mdash;" but at
this point Mr. Tredegar rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, your resorting to such arguments convinces
me that nothing is to be gained by prolonging
our talk. I will not even take up your insinuations
against two of the most respected men in the community&mdash;such
charges reflect only on those who make them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[p 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst, whose flame of anger had subsided with
the sudden sense of its futility, received this in silence,
and the lawyer, reassured, continued with a touch of
condescension: "My only specific charge from Mrs.
Westmore was to hand you this cheque; but, in spite
of what has passed, I take it upon myself to add, in her
behalf, that your conduct of today will not be allowed
to weigh against your record at the mills, and that the
extraordinary charges you have seen fit to bring against
your superiors will&mdash;if not repeated&mdash;simply be ignored."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When, the next morning at about ten, Mrs. Eustace
Ansell joined herself to the two gentlemen who still
lingered over a desultory breakfast in Mrs. Westmore's
dining-room, she responded to their greeting with less
than her usual vivacity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus-02.jpg"
alt="&quot;No&mdash;I shall have to ask you to take my word for it.&quot;"
title="&quot;No&mdash;I shall have to ask you to take my word for it.&quot;" />
<br /><span class="caption">&quot;No&mdash;I shall have to ask you to take my word for it.&quot;</span>
<br /><br /></div>

<p>It was one of Mrs. Ansell's arts to bring to the breakfast-table
just the right shade of sprightliness, a warmth
subdued by discretion as the early sunlight is tempered
by the lingering coolness of night. She was, in short,
as fresh, as temperate, as the hour, yet without the
concomitant chill which too often marks its human
atmosphere: rather her soft effulgence dissipated the
morning frosts, opening pinched spirits to a promise of
midday warmth. But on this occasion a mist of uncertainty
hung on her smile, and veiled the glance which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[p 83]</a></span>
she turned on the contents of the heavy silver dishes
successively presented to her notice. When, at the
conclusion of this ceremony, the servants had withdrawn,
she continued for a moment to stir her tea in
silence, while her glance travelled from Mr. Tredegar,
sunk in his morning mail, to Mr. Langhope, who
leaned back resignedly in his chair, trying to solace
himself with Hanaford Banner, till midday should
bring him a sight of the metropolitan press.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know," she said suddenly, "that
Bessy has telegraphed for Cicely, and made her arrangements
to stay here another week."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's stick slipped to the floor with the
sudden displacement of his whole lounging person, and
Mr. Tredegar, removing his tortoise-shell reading-glasses,
put them hastily into their case, as though to
declare for instant departure.</p>

<p>"My dear Maria&mdash;" Mr. Langhope gasped, while
she rose and restored his stick.</p>

<p>"She considers it, then, her duty to wait and see
Truscomb?" the lawyer asked; and Mrs. Ansell, regaining
her seat, murmured discreetly: "She puts it
so&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"My dear Maria&mdash;" Mr. Langhope repeated helplessly,
tossing aside his paper and drawing his chair up
to the table.</p>

<p>"But it would be perfectly easy to return: it is quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[p 84]</a></span>
unnecessary to wait here for his recovery," Mr. Tredegar
pursued, as though setting forth a fact which had
not hitherto presented itself to the more limited intelligence
of his hearers.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope emitted a short laugh, and Mrs. Ansell
answered gently: "She says she detests the long
journey."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar rose and gathered up his letters with
a gesture of annoyance. "In that case&mdash;if I had been
notified earlier of this decision, I might have caught
the morning train," he interrupted himself, glancing
resentfully at his watch.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't leave us, Tredegar," Mr. Langhope entreated.
"We'll reason with her&mdash;we'll persuade her
to go back by the three-forty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell smiled. "She telegraphed at seven.
Cicely and the governess are already on their way."</p>

<p>"At seven? But, my dear friend, why on earth
didn't you tell us?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know till a few minutes ago. Bessy called
me in as I was coming down."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" Mr. Langhope murmured, meeting her
eyes for a fraction of a second. In the encounter, she
appeared to communicate something more than she
had spoken, for as he stooped to pick up his paper he
said, more easily: "My dear Tredegar, if we're in a
box there's no reason why we should force you into it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[p 85]</a></span>
too. Ring for Ropes, and we'll look up a train for
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar appeared slightly ruffled at this prompt
acquiescence in his threatened departure. "Of course,
if I had been notified in advance, I might have arranged
to postpone my engagements another day; but
in any case, it is quite out of the question that I should
return in a week&mdash;and quite unnecessary," he added,
snapping his lips shut as though he were closing his
last portmanteau.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite&mdash;quite," Mr. Langhope assented. "It
isn't, in fact, in the least necessary for any of us either
to stay on now or to return. Truscomb could come
to Long Island when he recovers, and answer any questions
we may have to put; but if Bessy has sent for
the child, we must of course put off going for today&mdash;at
least I must," he added sighing, "and, though
I know it's out of the question to exact such a sacrifice
from you, I have a faint hope that our delightful
friend here, with the altruistic spirit of her sex&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall enjoy it&mdash;my maid is unpacking," Mrs.
Ansell gaily affirmed; and Mr. Tredegar, shrugging
his shoulders, said curtly: "In that case I will ring for
the time-table."</p>

<p>When he had withdrawn to consult it in the seclusion
of the library, and Mrs. Ansell, affecting a sudden desire
for a second cup of tea, had reseated herself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[p 86]</a></span>
await the replenishment of the kettle, Mr. Langhope
exchanged his own chair for a place at her side.</p>

<p>"Now what on earth does this mean?" he asked,
lighting a cigarette in response to her slight nod of
consent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell's gaze lost itself in the depths of the
empty tea-pot.</p>

<p>"A number of things&mdash;or any one of them," she said
at length, extending her arm toward the tea-caddy.</p>

<p>"For instance&mdash;?" he rejoined, following appreciatively
the movements of her long slim hands.</p>

<p>She raised her head and met his eyes. "For instance:
it may mean&mdash;don't resent the suggestion&mdash;that
you and Mr. Tredegar were not quite well-advised in persuading
her not to see Mr. Amherst yesterday evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Maria&mdash;in the name of reason...why,
after the doctor's visit&mdash;after his coming here last
night, at Truscomb's request, to put the actual facts
before her&mdash;should she have gone over the whole business
again with this interfering young fellow? How,
in fact, could she have done so," he added, after vainly
waiting for her reply, "without putting a sort of slight
on Truscomb, who is, after all, the only person entitled
to speak with authority?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell received his outburst in silence, and the
butler, reappearing with the kettle and fresh toast, gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[p 87]</a></span>
her the chance to prolong her pause for a full minute.
When the door had closed on him, she said: "Judged
by reason, your arguments are unanswerable; but when
it comes to a question of feeling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Feeling? What kind of feeling? You don't mean
to suggest anything so preposterous as that Bessy&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She made a gesture of smiling protest. "I confess
it is to be regretted that his mother is a lady, and that
he looks&mdash;you must have noticed it?&mdash;so amazingly
like the portraits of the young Schiller. But I only
meant that Bessy forms all her opinions emotionally;
and that she must have been very strongly affected by
the scene Mr. Tredegar described to us."</p>

<p>"Ah," Mr. Langhope interjected, replying first to
her parenthesis, "how a woman of your good sense
stumbled on that idea of hunting up the mother&mdash;!"
but Mrs. Ansell answered, with a slight grimace: "My
dear Henry, if you could see the house they live in you'd
think I had been providentially guided there!" and,
reverting to the main issue, he went on fretfully: "But
why, after hearing the true version of the facts, should
Bessy still be influenced by that sensational scene?
Even if it was not, as Tredegar suspects, cooked up
expressly to take her in, she must see that the hospital
doctor is, after all, as likely as any one to know how
the accident really happened, and how seriously the
fellow is hurt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[p 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's the point. Why should Bessy believe Dr.
Disbrow rather than Mr. Amherst?"</p>

<p>"For the best of reasons&mdash;because Disbrow has
nothing to gain by distorting the facts, whereas this
young Amherst, as Tredegar pointed out, has the very
obvious desire to give Truscomb a bad name and shove
himself into his place."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell contemplatively turned the rings upon
her fingers. "From what I saw of Amherst I'm inclined
to think that, if that is his object, he is too clever
to have shown his hand so soon. But if you are right,
was there not all the more reason for letting Bessy see
him and find out as soon as possible what he was aiming
at?"</p>

<p>"If one could have trusted her to find out&mdash;but you
credit my poor child with more penetration than I've
ever seen in her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you've looked for it at the wrong time&mdash;and
about the wrong things. Bessy has the penetration
of the heart."</p>

<p>"The heart! You make mine jump when you use
such expressions."</p>

<p>"Oh, I use this one in a general sense. But I want
to help you to keep it from acquiring a more restricted
significance."</p>

<p>"Restricted&mdash;to the young man himself?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell's expressive hands seemed to commit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[p 89]</a></span>
question to fate. "All I ask you to consider for the
present is that Bessy is quite unoccupied and excessively
bored."</p>

<p>"Bored? Why, she has everything on earth she can
want!"</p>

<p>"The ideal state for producing boredom&mdash;the only
atmosphere in which it really thrives. And besides&mdash;to
be humanly inconsistent&mdash;there's just one thing she
hasn't got."</p>

<p>"Well?" Mr. Langhope groaned, fortifying himself
with a second cigarette.</p>

<p>"An occupation for that rudimentary little organ,
the mention of which makes you jump."</p>

<p>"There you go again! Good heavens, Maria, do you
want to encourage her to fall in love?"</p>

<p>"Not with a man, just at present, but with a hobby,
an interest, by all means. If she doesn't, the man will
take the place of the interest&mdash;there's a vacuum to be
filled, and human nature abhors a vacuum."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope shrugged his shoulders. "I don't
follow you. She adored her husband."</p>

<p>His friend's fine smile was like a magnifying glass
silently applied to the gross stupidity of his remark.
"Oh, I don't say it was a great passion&mdash;but they got
on perfectly," he corrected himself.</p>

<p>"So perfectly that you must expect her to want a
little storm and stress for a change. The mere fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[p 90]</a></span>
that you and Mr. Tredegar objected to her seeing Mr.
Amherst last night has roused the spirit of opposition
in her. A year ago she hadn't any spirit of opposition."</p>

<p>"There was nothing for her to oppose&mdash;poor Dick
made her life so preposterously easy."</p>

<p>"My ingenuous friend! Do you still think that's any
reason? The fact is, Bessy wasn't awake, she wasn't
even born, then.... She is now, and you know the
infant's first conscious joy is to smash things."</p>

<p>"It will be rather an expensive joy if the mills are
the first thing she smashes."</p>

<p>"Oh I imagine the mills are pretty substantial. I
should, I own," Mrs. Ansell smiled, "not object to seeing
her try her teeth on them."</p>

<p>"Which, in terms of practical conduct, means&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That I advise you not to disapprove of her staying
on, or of her investigating the young man's charges.
You must remember that another peculiarity of the
infant mind is to tire soonest of the toy that no one
tries to take away from it."</p>

<p>"<i>Que diable!</i> But suppose Truscomb turns rusty
at this very unusual form of procedure? Perhaps you
don't quite know how completely he represents the
prosperity of the mills."</p>

<p>"All the more reason," Mrs. Ansell persisted, rising
at the sound of Mr. Tredegar's approach. "For don't
you perceive, my poor distracted friend, that if Trus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[p 91]</a></span>comb
turns rusty, as he undoubtedly will, the inevitable
result will be his manager's dismissal&mdash;and that thereafter
there will presumably be peace in Warsaw?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you divinely wicked woman!" cried Mr. Langhope,
snatching at an appreciative pressure of her hand
as the lawyer reappeared in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> daylight that same morning Amherst,
dressing by the gas-flame above his cheap wash-stand,
strove to bring some order into his angry thoughts.
It humbled him to feel his purpose tossing rudderless
on unruly waves of emotion, yet strive as he would he
could not regain a hold on it. The events of the last
twenty-four hours had been too rapid and unexpected
for him to preserve his usual clear feeling of mastery;
and he had, besides, to reckon with the first complete
surprise of his senses. His way of life had excluded
him from all contact with the subtler feminine influences,
and the primitive side of the relation left his
imagination untouched. He was therefore the more assailable
by those refined forms of the ancient spell that
lurk in delicacy of feeling interpreted by loveliness of
face. By his own choice he had cut himself off from
all possibility of such communion; had accepted complete
abstinence for that part of his nature which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[p 92]</a></span>
have offered a refuge from the stern prose of his daily
task. But his personal indifference to his surroundings&mdash;deliberately
encouraged as a defiance to the attractions
of the life he had renounced&mdash;proved no defence
against this appeal; rather, the meanness of his surroundings
combined with his inherited refinement of
taste to deepen the effect of Bessy's charm.</p>

<p>As he reviewed the incidents of the past hours, a reaction
of self-derision came to his aid. What was this
exquisite opportunity from which he had cut himself
off? What, to reduce the question to a personal issue,
had Mrs. Westmore said or done that, on the part of a
plain woman, would have quickened his pulses by the
least fraction of a second? Why, it was only the old
story of the length of Cleopatra's nose! Because her
eyes were a heavenly vehicle for sympathy, because her
voice was pitched to thrill the tender chords, he had
been deluded into thinking that she understood and responded
to his appeal. And her own emotions had
been wrought upon by means as cheap: it was only the
obvious, theatrical side of the incident that had affected
her. If Dillon's wife had been old and ugly, would
she have been clasped to her employer's bosom? A
more expert knowledge of the sex would have told Amherst
that such ready sympathy is likely to be followed
by as prompt a reaction of indifference. Luckily Mrs.
Westmore's course had served as a corrective for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[p 93]</a></span>
lack of experience; she had even, as it appeared, been
at some pains to hasten the process of disillusionment.
This timely discipline left him blushing at his own insincerity;
for he now saw that he had risked his future
not because of his zeal for the welfare of the mill-hands,
but because Mrs. Westmore's look was like sunshine
on his frozen senses, and because he was resolved,
at any cost, to arrest her attention, to associate himself
with her by the only means in his power.</p>

<p>Well, he deserved to fail with such an end in view;
and the futility of his scheme was matched by the
vanity of his purpose. In the cold light of disenchantment
it seemed as though he had tried to build an impregnable
fortress out of nursery blocks. How could
he have foreseen anything but failure for so preposterous
an attempt? His breach of discipline would of course
be reported at once to Mr. Gaines and Truscomb; and
the manager, already jealous of his assistant's popularity
with the hands, which was a tacit criticism of his
own methods, would promptly seize the pretext to be
rid of him. Amherst was aware that only his technical
efficiency, and his knack of getting the maximum
of work out of the operatives, had secured him from
Truscomb's animosity. From the outset there had
been small sympathy between the two; but the scarcity
of competent and hard-working assistants had made
Truscomb endure him for what he was worth to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[p 94]</a></span>
mills. Now, however, his own folly had put the match
to the manager's smouldering dislike, and he saw himself,
in consequence, discharged and black-listed, and
perhaps roaming for months in quest of a job. He
knew the efficiency of that far-reaching system of
defamation whereby the employers of labour pursue
and punish the subordinate who incurs their displeasure.
In the case of a mere operative this secret persecution
often worked complete ruin; and even to a
man of Amherst's worth it opened the dispiriting prospect
of a long struggle for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Deep down, he suffered most at the thought that his
blow for the operatives had failed; but on the surface
it was the manner of his failure that exasperated him.
For it seemed to prove him unfit for the very work to
which he was drawn: that yearning to help the world
forward that, in some natures, sets the measure to
which the personal adventure must keep step. Amherst
had hitherto felt himself secured by his insight
and self-control from the emotional errors besetting
the way of the enthusiast; and behold, he had stumbled
into the first sentimental trap in his path, and
tricked his eyes with a Christmas-chromo vision of
lovely woman dispensing coals and blankets! Luckily,
though such wounds to his self-confidence cut deep, he
could apply to them the antiseptic of an unfailing
humour; and before he had finished dressing, the pic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[p 95]</a></span>ture
of his wide schemes of social reform contracting
to a blue-eyed philanthropy of cheques and groceries,
had provoked a reaction of laughter. Perhaps the
laughter came too soon, and rang too loud, to be true
to the core; but at any rate it healed the edges of his
hurt, and gave him a sound surface of composure.</p>

<p>But he could not laugh away the thought of the trials
to which his intemperance had probably exposed his
mother; and when, at the breakfast-table, from which
Duplain had already departed, she broke into praise
of their visitor, it was like a burning irritant on his
wound.</p>

<p>"What a face, John! Of course I don't often see
people of that kind now&mdash;" the words, falling from her
too simply to be reproachful, wrung him, for that, all
the more&mdash;"but I'm sure that kind of soft loveliness is
rare everywhere; like a sweet summer morning with
the mist on it. The Gaines girls, now, are my idea of
the modern type; very handsome, of course, but you
see just <i>how</i> handsome the first minute. I like a story
that keeps one wondering till the end. It was very
kind of Maria Ansell," Mrs. Amherst wandered happily
on, "to come and hunt me out yesterday, and I enjoyed
our quiet talk about old times. But what I liked best
was seeing Mrs. Westmore&mdash;and, oh, John, if she came
to live here, what a benediction to the mills!"</p>

<p>Amherst was silent, moved most of all by the unim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[p 96]</a></span>paired
simplicity of heart with which his mother could
take up past relations, and open her meagre life to the
high visitations of grace and fashion, without a tinge of
self-consciousness or apology. "I shall never be as
genuine as that," he thought, remembering how he
had wished to have Mrs. Westmore know that he was
of her own class. How mixed our passions are, and
how elastic must be the word that would cover any one
of them! Amherst's, at that moment, were all stained
with the deep wound to his self-love.</p>

<p>The discolouration he carried in his eye made the
mill-village seem more than commonly cheerless and
ugly as he walked over to the office after breakfast.
Beyond the grim roof-line of the factories a dazzle of
rays sent upward from banked white clouds the promise
of another brilliant day; and he reflected that Mrs.
Westmore would soon be speeding home to the joy of
a gallop over the plains.</p>

<p>Far different was the task that awaited him&mdash;yet it
gave him a pang to think that he might be performing
it for the last time. In spite of Mr. Tredegar's assurances,
he was certain that the report of his conduct
must by this time have reached the President, and been
transmitted to Truscomb; the latter was better that
morning, and the next day he would doubtless call his
rebellious assistant to account. Amherst, meanwhile,
took up his routine with a dull heart. Even should his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[p 97]</a></span>
offense be condoned, his occupation presented, in itself,
little future to a man without money or powerful connections.
Money! He had spurned the thought of it in
choosing his work, yet he now saw that, without its aid,
he was powerless to accomplish the object to which his
personal desires had been sacrificed. His love of his
craft had gradually been merged in the larger love for
his fellow-workers, and in the resulting desire to lift
and widen their lot. He had once fancied that this
end might be attained by an internal revolution in the
management of the Westmore mills; that he might
succeed in creating an industrial object-lesson conspicuous
enough to point the way to wiser law-making
and juster relations between the classes. But the last
hours' experiences had shown him how vain it was
to assault single-handed the strong barrier between
money and labour, and how his own dash at the breach
had only thrust him farther back into the obscure ranks
of the stragglers. It was, after all, only through politics
that he could return successfully to the attack; and
financial independence was the needful preliminary to
a political career. If he had stuck to the law he might,
by this time, have been nearer his goal; but then the
gold might not have mattered, since it was only by
living among the workers that he had learned to care
for their fate. And rather than have forfeited that
poignant yet mighty vision of the onward groping of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[p 98]</a></span>
the mass, rather than have missed the widening of his
own nature that had come through sharing their hopes
and pains, he would still have turned from the easier
way, have chosen the deeper initiation rather than the
readier attainment.</p>

<p>But this philosophic view of the situation was a mere
thread of light on the farthest verge of his sky: much
nearer were the clouds of immediate care, amid which
his own folly, and his mother's possible suffering from
it, loomed darkest; and these considerations made him
resolve that, if his insubordination were overlooked, he
would swallow the affront of a pardon, and continue
for the present in the mechanical performance of his
duties. He had just brought himself to this leaden
state of acquiescence when one of the clerks in the outer
office thrust his head in to say: "A lady asking for
you&mdash;" and looking up, Amherst beheld Bessy Westmore.</p>

<p>She came in alone, with an air of high self-possession
in marked contrast to her timidity and indecision of the
previous day. Amherst thought she looked taller, more
majestic; so readily may the upward slant of a soft
chin, the firmer line of yielding brows, add a cubit to
the outward woman. Her aspect was so commanding
that he fancied she had come to express her disapproval
of his conduct, to rebuke him for lack of respect
to Mr. Tredegar; but a moment later it became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[p 99]</a></span>
clear, even to his inexperienced perceptions, that it was
not to himself that her challenge was directed.</p>

<p>She advanced toward the seat he had moved forward,
but in her absorption forgot to seat herself, and stood
with her clasped hands resting on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>"I have come back to talk to you," she began, in her
sweet voice with its occasional quick lift of appeal. "I
knew that, in Mr. Truscomb's absence, it would be
hard for you to leave the mills, and there are one or two
things I want you to explain before I go away&mdash;some
of the things, for instance, that you spoke to Mr. Tredegar
about last night."</p>

<p>Amherst's feeling of constraint returned. "I'm
afraid I expressed myself badly; I may have annoyed
him&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>She smiled this away, as though irrelevant to the
main issue. "Perhaps you don't quite understand each
other&mdash;but I am sure you can make it clear to me."
She sank into the chair, resting one arm on the edge of
the desk behind which he had resumed his place.
"That is the reason why I came alone," she continued.
"I never can understand when a lot of people are trying
to tell me a thing all at once. And I don't suppose I
care as much as a man would&mdash;a lawyer especially&mdash;about
the forms that ought to be observed. All I want
is to find out what is wrong and how to remedy it."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes met Amherst's in a look that flowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[p 100]</a></span>
like warmth about his heart. How should he have
doubted that her feelings were as exquisite as her means
of expressing them? The iron bands of distrust were
loosened from his spirit, and he blushed for his cheap
scepticism of the morning. In a woman so evidently
nurtured in dependence, whose views had been formed,
and her actions directed, by the most conventional influences,
the mere fact of coming alone to Westmore,
in open defiance of her advisers, bespoke a persistence
of purpose that put his doubts to shame.</p>

<p>"It will make a great difference to the people here if
you interest yourself in them," he rejoined. "I tried
to explain to Mr. Tredegar that I had no wish to criticise
the business management of the mills&mdash;even if
there had been any excuse for my doing so&mdash;but that I
was sure the condition of the operatives could be very
much improved, without permanent harm to the business,
by any one who felt a personal sympathy for
them; and in the end I believe such sympathy produces
better work, and so benefits the employer materially."</p>

<p>She listened with her gentle look of trust, as though
committing to him, with the good faith of a child, her
ignorance, her credulity, her little rudimentary convictions
and her little tentative aspirations, relying on him
not to abuse or misdirect them in the boundless supremacy
of his masculine understanding.</p>

<p>"That is just what I want you to explain to me,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[p 101]</a></span>
she said. "But first I should like to know more about
the poor man who was hurt. I meant to see his wife
yesterday, but Mr. Gaines told me she would be at work
till six, and it would have been difficult to go after that.
I <i>did</i> go to the hospital; but the man was sleeping&mdash;is
Dillon his name?&mdash;and the matron told us he was much
better. Dr. Disbrow came in the evening and said the
same thing&mdash;told us it was all a false report about his
having been so badly hurt, and that Mr. Truscomb was
very much annoyed when he heard of your having said,
before the operatives, that Dillon would lose his arm."</p>

<p>Amherst smiled. "Ah&mdash;Mr. Truscomb heard that?
Well, he's right to be annoyed: I ought not to have
said it when I did. But unfortunately I am not the
only one to be punished. The operative who tied on
the black cloth was dismissed this morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore flamed up. "Dismissed for that?
Oh, how unjust&mdash;how cruel!"</p>

<p>"You must look at both sides of the case," said Amherst,
finding it much easier to remain temperate in the
glow he had kindled than if he had had to force his
own heat into frozen veins. "Of course any act of insubordination
must be reprimanded&mdash;but I think a
reprimand would have been enough."</p>

<p>It gave him an undeniable throb of pleasure to find
that she was not to be checked by such arguments.
"But he shall be put back&mdash;I won't have any one dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[p 102]</a></span>charged
for such a reason! You must find him for me
at once&mdash;you must tell him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more Amherst gently restrained her. "If
you'll forgive my saying so, I think it is better to let
him go, and take his chance of getting work elsewhere.
If he were taken back he might be made to suffer. As
things are organized here, the hands are very much at
the mercy of the overseers, and the overseer in that
room would be likely to make it uncomfortable for a
hand who had so openly defied him."</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh she bent her puzzled brows on him.
"How complicated it is! I wonder if I shall ever
understand it all. <i>You</i> don't think Dillon's accident
was his own fault, then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; there are too many cards in that
room. I pointed out the fact to Mr. Truscomb when
the new machines were set up three years ago. An
operative may be ever so expert with his fingers, and
yet not learn to measure his ordinary movements quite
as accurately as if he were an automaton; and that is
what a man must do to be safe in the carding-room."</p>

<p>She sighed again. "The more you tell me, the more
difficult it all seems. Why is the carding-room so over-crowded?"</p>

<p>"To make it pay better," Amherst returned bluntly;
and the colour flushed her sensitive skin.</p>

<p>He thought she was about to punish him for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[p 103]</a></span>
plain-speaking; but she went on after a pause: "What
you say is dreadful. Each thing seems to lead back to
another&mdash;and I feel so ignorant of it all." She hesitated
again, and then said, turning her bluest glance on
him: "I am going to be quite frank with you, Mr.
Amherst. Mr. Tredegar repeated to me what you said
to him last night, and I think he was annoyed that you
were unwilling to give any proof of the charges you
made."</p>

<p>"Charges? Ah," Amherst exclaimed, with a start of
recollection, "he means my refusing to say who told me
that Dr. Disbrow was not telling the truth about Dillon?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He said that was a very grave accusation to
make, and that no one should have made it without
being able to give proof."</p>

<p>"That is quite true, theoretically. But in this case
it would be easy for you or Mr. Tredegar to find out
whether I was right."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Tredegar said you refused to say who told
you."</p>

<p>"I was bound to, as it happened. But I am not
bound to prevent your trying to get the same information."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" she murmured understandingly; and, a sudden
thought striking him, he went on, with a glance at
the clock: "If you really wish to judge for yourself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[p 104]</a></span>
why not go to the hospital now? I shall be free in
five minutes, and could go with you if you wish it."</p>

<p>Amherst had remembered the nurse's cry of recognition
when she saw Mrs. Westmore's face under the
street-lamp; and it immediately occurred to him that,
if the two women had really known each other, Mrs.
Westmore would have no difficulty in obtaining the information
she wanted; while, even if they met as
strangers, the dark-eyed girl's perspicacity might still
be trusted to come to their aid. It remained only to
be seen how Mrs. Westmore would take his suggestion;
but some instinct was already telling him that the highhanded
method was the one she really preferred.</p>

<p>"To the hospital&mdash;now? I should like it of all
things," she exclaimed, rising with what seemed an
almost childish zest in the adventure. "Of course that
is the best way of finding out. I ought to have insisted
on seeing Dillon yesterday&mdash;but I begin to think the
matron didn't want me to."</p>

<p>Amherst left this inference to work itself out in her
mind, contenting himself, as they drove back to Hanaford,
with answering her questions about Dillon's family,
the ages of his children, and his wife's health. Her
enquiries, he noticed, did not extend from the particular
to the general: her curiosity, as yet, was too purely personal
and emotional to lead to any larger consideration
of the question. But this larger view might grow out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[p 105]</a></span>
of the investigation of Dillon's case; and meanwhile
Amherst's own purposes were momentarily lost in the
sweet confusion of feeling her near him&mdash;of seeing the
exquisite grain of her skin, the way her lashes grew out
of a dusky line on the edge of the white lids, the way
her hair, stealing in spirals of light from brow to ear,
wavered off into a fruity down on the edge of the cheek.</p>

<p>At the hospital they were protestingly admitted by
Mrs. Ogan, though the official "visitors' hour" was not
till the afternoon; and beside the sufferer's bed, Amherst
saw again that sudden flowering of compassion
which seemed the key to his companion's beauty: as
though her lips had been formed for consolation and
her hands for tender offices. It was clear enough that
Dillon, still sunk in a torpor broken by feverish tossings,
was making no perceptible progress toward recovery;
and Mrs. Ogan was reduced to murmuring
some technical explanation about the state of the wound
while Bessy hung above him with reassuring murmurs
as to his wife's fate, and promises that the children
should be cared for.</p>

<p>Amherst had noticed, on entering, that a new nurse&mdash;a
gaping young woman instantly lost in the study of
Mrs. Westmore's toilet&mdash;had replaced the dark-eyed
attendant of the day before; and supposing that the
latter was temporarily off duty, he asked Mrs. Ogan
if she might be seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[p 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The matron's face was a picture of genteel perplexity.
"The other nurse? Our regular surgical nurse, Miss
Golden, is ill&mdash;Miss Hibbs, here, is replacing her for
the present." She indicated the gaping damsel; then,
as Amherst persisted: "Ah," she wondered negligently,
"do you mean the young lady you saw here yesterday?
Certainly&mdash;I had forgotten: Miss Brent was merely a&mdash;er&mdash;temporary
substitute. I believe she was recommended
to Dr. Disbrow by one of his patients; but we
found her quite unsuitable&mdash;in fact, unfitted&mdash;and the
doctor discharged her this morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westmore had drawn near, and while the matron
delivered her explanation, with an uneasy sorting
and shifting of words, a quick signal of intelligence
passed between her hearers. "You see?" Amherst's
eyes exclaimed; "I see&mdash;they have sent her away because
she told you," Bessy's flashed back in wrath, and
his answering look did not deny her inference.</p>

<p>"Do you know where she has gone?" Amherst enquired;
but Mrs. Ogan, permitting her brows a faint
lift of surprise, replied that she had no idea of Miss
Brent's movements, beyond having heard that she was
to leave Hanaford immediately</p>

<p>In the carriage Bessy exclaimed: "It was the nurse,
of course&mdash;if we could only find her! Brent&mdash;did Mrs.
Ogan say her name was Brent?"</p>

<p>"Do you know the name?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[p 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at least&mdash;but it couldn't, of course, be the
girl I knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Brent saw you the night you arrived, and
thought she recognized you. She said you and she had
been at some school or convent together."</p>

<p>"The Sacred Heart? Then it <i>is</i> Justine Brent! I
heard they had lost their money&mdash;I haven't seen her for
years. But how strange that she should be a hospital
nurse! And why is she at Hanaford, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"She was here only on a visit; she didn't tell me
where she lived. She said she heard that a surgical
nurse was wanted at the hospital, and volunteered her
services; I'm afraid she got small thanks for them."</p>

<p>"Do you really think they sent her away for talking
to you? How do you suppose they found out?"</p>

<p>"I waited for her last night when she left the hospital,
and I suppose Mrs. Ogan or one of the doctors
saw us. It was thoughtless of me," Amherst exclaimed
with compunction.</p>

<p>"I wish I had seen her&mdash;poor Justine! We were the
greatest friends at the convent. She was the ringleader
in all our mischief&mdash;I never saw any one so quick
and clever. I suppose her fun is all gone now."</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Westmore's mind continued to
linger among her memories; then she reverted to the
question of the Dillons, and of what might best be done
for them if Miss Brent's fears should be realized.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[p 108]</a></span></p>

<p>As the carriage neared her door she turned to her
companion with extended hand. "Thank you so
much, Mr. Amherst. I am glad you suggested that
Mr. Truscomb should find some work for Dillon about
the office. But I must talk to you about this again&mdash;can
you come in this evening?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Amherst</span> could never afterward regain a detailed
impression of the weeks that followed. They
lived in his memory chiefly as exponents of the unforeseen,
nothing he had looked for having come to pass
in the way or at the time expected; while the whole
movement of life was like the noon-day flow of a river,
in which the separate ripples of brightness are all
merged in one blinding glitter. His recurring conferences
with Mrs. Westmore formed, as it were, the small
surprising kernel of fact about which sensations gathered
and grew with the swift ripening of a magician's
fruit. That she should remain on at Hanaford to look
into the condition of the mills did not, in itself, seem
surprising to Amherst; for his short phase of doubt
had been succeeded by an abundant inflow of faith in
her intentions. It satisfied his inner craving for harmony
that her face and spirit should, after all, so corroborate
and complete each other; that it needed no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[p 109]</a></span>
moral sophistry to adjust her acts to her appearance,
her words to the promise of her smile. But her immediate
confidence in him, her resolve to support him in
his avowed insubordination, to ignore, with the royal
license of her sex, all that was irregular and inexpedient
in asking his guidance while the whole official strength
of the company darkened the background with a gathering
storm of disapproval&mdash;this sense of being the glove
flung by her hand in the face of convention, quickened
astonishingly the flow of Amherst's sensations. It was
as though a mountain-climber, braced to the strain of
a hard ascent, should suddenly see the way break into
roses, and level itself in a path for his feet.</p>

<p>On his second visit he found the two ladies together,
and Mrs. Ansell's smile of approval seemed to cast a
social sanction on the episode, to classify it as comfortably
usual and unimportant. He could see that her
friend's manner put Bessy at ease, helping her to ask
her own questions, and to reflect on his suggestions,
with less bewilderment and more self-confidence.
Mrs. Ansell had the faculty of restoring to her the belief
in her reasoning powers that her father could dissolve
in a monosyllable.</p>

<p>The talk, on this occasion, had turned mainly on the
future of the Dillon family, on the best means of compensating
for the accident, and, incidentally, on the
care of the young children of the mill-colony. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[p 110]</a></span>
Amherst did not believe in the extremer forms of industrial
paternalism, he was yet of opinion that, where
married women were employed, the employer should
care for their children. He had been gradually, and
somewhat reluctantly, brought to this conviction by the
many instances of unavoidable neglect and suffering
among the children of the women-workers at Westmore;
and Mrs. Westmore took up the scheme with all the
ardour of her young motherliness, quivering at the
thought of hungry or ailing children while her Cicely,
leaning a silken head against her, lifted puzzled eyes
to her face.</p>

<p>On the larger problems of the case it was less easy to
fix Bessy's attention; but Amherst was far from being
one of the extreme theorists who reject temporary
remedies lest they defer the day of general renewal, and
since he looked on every gain in the material condition
of the mill-hands as a step in their moral growth,
he was quite willing to hold back his fundamental plans
while he discussed the establishment of a nursery, and
of a night-school for the boys in the mills.</p>

<p>The third time he called, he found Mr. Langhope
and Mr. Halford Gaines of the company. The President
of the Westmore mills was a trim middle-sized
man, whose high pink varnish of good living would
have turned to purple could he have known Mr. Langhope's
opinion of his jewelled shirt-front and the padded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[p 111]</a></span>
shoulders of his evening-coat. Happily he had no
inkling of these views, and was fortified in his command
of the situation by an unimpaired confidence in his own
appearance; while Mr. Langhope, discreetly withdrawn
behind a veil of cigar-smoke, let his silence play like a
fine criticism over the various phases of the discussion.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to Amherst to find himself in Mr.
Gaines's presence. The President, secluded in his
high office, seldom visited the mills, and when there
showed no consciousness of any presence lower than
Truscomb's; and Amherst's first thought was that, in
the manager's enforced absence, he was to be called to
account by the head of the firm. But he was affably
welcomed by Mr. Gaines, who made it clear that his
ostensible purpose in coming was to hear Amherst's
views as to the proposed night-schools and nursery.
These were pointedly alluded to as Mrs. Westmore's
projects, and the young man was made to feel that he
was merely called in as a temporary adviser in Truscomb's
absence. This was, in fact, the position Amherst
preferred to take, and he scrupulously restricted
himself to the answering of questions, letting Mrs.
Westmore unfold his plans as though they had been
her own. "It is much better," he reflected, "that they
should all think so, and she too, for Truscomb will be
on his legs again in a day or two, and then my hours
will be numbered."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[p 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile he was surprised to find Mr. Gaines oddly
amenable to the proposed innovations, which he appeared
to regard as new fashions in mill-management,
to be adopted for the same cogent reasons as a new
cut in coat-tails.</p>

<p>"Of course we want to be up-to-date&mdash;there's no
reason why the Westmore mills shouldn't do as well
by their people as any mills in the country," he affirmed,
in the tone of the entertainer accustomed to
say: "I want the thing done handsomely." But he
seemed even less conscious than Mrs. Westmore that
each particular wrong could be traced back to a radical
vice in the system. He appeared to think that every
murmur of assent to her proposals passed the sponge,
once for all, over the difficulty propounded: as though
a problem in algebra should be solved by wiping it off
the blackboard.</p>

<p>"My dear Bessy, we all owe you a debt of gratitude
for coming here, and bringing, so to speak, a fresh eye
to bear on the subject. If I've been, perhaps, a little
too exclusively absorbed in making the mills profitable,
my friend Langhope will, I believe, not be the first to&mdash;er&mdash;cast
a stone at me." Mr. Gaines, who was the
soul of delicacy, stumbled a little over the awkward
associations connected with this figure, but, picking himself
up, hastened on to affirm: "And in that respect, I
think we can challenge comparison with any industry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[p 113]</a></span>
in the state; but I am the first to admit that there may
be another side, a side that it takes a woman&mdash;a mother&mdash;to
see. For instance," he threw in jocosely, "I flatter
myself that I know how to order a good dinner;
but I always leave the flowers to my wife. And if
you'll permit me to say so," he went on, encouraged by
the felicity of his image, "I believe it will produce a
most pleasing effect&mdash;not only on the operatives themselves,
but on the whole of Hanaford&mdash;on our own set of
people especially&mdash;to have you come here and interest
yourself in the&mdash;er&mdash;philanthropic side of the work."</p>

<p>Bessy coloured a little. She blushed easily, and was
perhaps not over-discriminating as to the quality of
praise received; but under her ripple of pleasure a
stronger feeling stirred, and she said hastily: "I am
afraid I never should have thought of these things if
Mr. Amherst had not pointed them out to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Gaines met this blandly. "Very gratifying to
Mr. Amherst to have you put it in that way; and I am
sure we all appreciate his valuable hints. Truscomb
himself could not have been more helpful, though his
larger experience will no doubt be useful later on, in
developing and&mdash;er&mdash;modifying your plans."</p>

<p>It was difficult to reconcile this large view of the moral
issue with the existence of abuses which made the management
of the Westmore mills as unpleasantly notorious
in one section of the community as it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[p 114]</a></span>
agreeably notable in another. But Amherst was impartial
enough to see that Mr. Gaines was unconscious
of the incongruities of the situation. He left the reconciling
of incompatibles to Truscomb with the simple
faith of the believer committing a like task to his
maker: it was in the manager's mind that the dark
processes of adjustment took place. Mr. Gaines cultivated
the convenient and popular idea that by ignoring
wrongs one is not so much condoning as actually denying
their existence; and in pursuance of this belief he
devoutly abstained from studying the conditions at
Westmore.</p>

<p>A farther surprise awaited Amherst when Truscomb
reappeared in the office. The manager was always a
man of few words; and for the first days his intercourse
with his assistant was restricted to asking questions and
issuing orders. Soon afterward, it became known that
Dillon's arm was to be amputated, and that afternoon
Truscomb was summoned to see Mrs. Westmore. When
he returned he sent for Amherst; and the young man
felt sure that his hour had come.</p>

<p>He was at dinner when the message reached him,
and he knew from the tightening of his mother's lips
that she too interpreted it in the same way. He was
glad that Duplain's presence kept her from speaking
her fears; and he thanked her inwardly for the smile
with which she watched him go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[p 115]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening, when he returned, the smile was still
at its post; but it dropped away wearily as he said, with
his hands on her shoulders: "Don't worry, mother; I
don't know exactly what's happening, but we're not
blacklisted yet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst had immediately taken up her work,
letting her nervous tension find its usual escape through
her finger-tips. Her needles flagged as she lifted her
eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Something <i>is</i> happening, then?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, a number of things, evidently&mdash;but though I'm
in the heart of them, I can't yet make out how they
are going to affect me."</p>

<p>His mother's glance twinkled in time with the flash
of her needles. "There's always a safe place in the
heart of a storm," she said shrewdly; and Amherst rejoined
with a laugh: "Well, if it's Truscomb's heart,
I don't know that it's particularly safe for me."</p>

<p>"Tell me just what he said, John," she begged,
making no attempt to carry the pleasantry farther,
though its possibilities still seemed to flicker about her
lip; and Amherst proceeded to recount his talk with
the manager.</p>

<p>Truscomb, it appeared, had made no allusion to
Dillon; his avowed purpose in summoning his assistant
had been to discuss with the latter the question of
the proposed nursery and schools. Mrs. Westmore, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[p 116]</a></span>
Amherst's suggestion, had presented these projects as
her own; but the question of a site having come up,
she had mentioned to Truscomb his assistant's proposal
that the company should buy for the purpose
the notorious Eldorado. The road-house in question
had always been one of the most destructive influences
in the mill-colony, and Amherst had made one or two
indirect attempts to have the building converted to
other uses; but the persistent opposition he encountered
gave colour to the popular report that the manager
took a high toll from the landlord.</p>

<p>It therefore at once occurred to Amherst to suggest
the purchase of the property to Mrs. Westmore; and
he was not surprised to find that Truscomb's opposition
to the scheme centred in the choice of the building.
But even at this point the manager betrayed no open
resistance; he seemed tacitly to admit Amherst's right
to discuss the proposed plans, and even to be consulted
concerning the choice of a site. He was ready with a
dozen good reasons against the purchase of the road-house;
but here also he proceeded with a discretion
unexampled in his dealings with his subordinates. He
acknowledged the harm done by the dance-hall, but
objected that he could not conscientiously advise the
company to pay the extortionate price at which it was
held, and reminded Amherst that, if that particular
source of offense were removed, others would inevitably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[p 117]</a></span>
spring up to replace it; marshalling the usual temporizing
arguments of tolerance and expediency, with
no marked change from his usual tone, till, just as the
interview was ending, he asked, with a sudden drop
to conciliation, if the assistant manager had anything
to complain of in the treatment he received.</p>

<p>This came as such a surprise to Amherst that before
he had collected himself he found Truscomb ambiguously
but unmistakably offering him&mdash;with the practised
indirection of the man accustomed to cover his
share in such transactions&mdash;a substantial "consideration"
for dropping the matter of the road-house. It
was incredible, yet it had really happened: the all-powerful
Truscomb, who held Westmore in the hollow
of his hand, had stooped to bribing his assistant because
he was afraid to deal with him in a more summary
manner. Amherst's leap of anger at the offer
was curbed by the instant perception of its cause. He
had no time to search for a reason; he could only rally
himself to meet the unintelligible with a composure as
abysmal as Truscomb's; and his voice still rang with
the wonder of the incident as he retailed it to his
mother.</p>

<p>"Think of what it means, mother, for a young woman
like Mrs. Westmore, without any experience or any
habit of authority, to come here, and at the first glimpse
of injustice, to be so revolted that she finds the courage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[p 118]</a></span>
and cleverness to put her little hand to the machine and
reverse the engines&mdash;for it's nothing less that she's
done! Oh, I know there'll be a reaction&mdash;the pendulum's
sure to swing back: but you'll see it won't swing
<i>as far</i>. Of course I shall go in the end&mdash;but Truscomb
may go too: Jove, if I could pull him down on me, like
what's-his-name and the pillars of the temple!"</p>

<p>He had risen and was measuring the little sitting-room
with his long strides, his head flung back and his
eyes dark with the inward look his mother had not
always cared to see there. But now her own glance
seemed to have caught a ray from his, and the knitting
flowed from her hands like the thread of fate, as she
sat silent, letting him exhale his hopes and his wonder,
and murmuring only, when he dropped again to the
chair at her side: "You won't go, Johnny&mdash;you won't
go."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Westmore lingered on for over two weeks, and
during that time Amherst was able, in various directions,
to develop her interest in the mill-workers. His
own schemes involved a complete readjustment of the
relation between the company and the hands: the suppression
of the obsolete company "store" and tenements,
which had so long sapped the thrift and ambition
of the workers; the transformation of the Hopewood
grounds into a park and athletic field, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[p 119]</a></span>
division of its remaining acres into building lots for the
mill-hands; the establishing of a library, a dispensary
and emergency hospital, and various other centres of
humanizing influence; but he refrained from letting her
see that his present suggestion was only a part of this
larger plan, lest her growing sympathy should be
checked. He had in his mother an example of the
mind accessible only to concrete impressions: the mind
which could die for the particular instance, yet remain
serenely indifferent to its causes. To Mrs. Amherst,
her son's work had been interesting simply because it
<i>was</i> his work: remove his presence from Westmore,
and the whole industrial problem became to her as non-existent
as star-dust to the naked eye. And in Bessy
Westmore he divined a nature of the same quality&mdash;divined,
but no longer criticized it. Was not that concentration
on the personal issue just the compensating
grace of her sex? Did it not offer a warm tint of human
inconsistency to eyes chilled by contemplating life
in the mass? It pleased Amherst for the moment to
class himself with the impersonal student of social problems,
though in truth his interest in them had its source
in an imagination as open as Bessy's to the pathos of
the personal appeal. But if he had the same sensitiveness,
how inferior were his means of expressing it!
Again and again, during their talks, he had the feeling
which had come to him when she bent over Dillon's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[p 120]</a></span>
bed&mdash;that her exquisite lines were, in some mystical
sense, the visible flowering of her nature, that they had
taken shape in response to the inward motions of the
heart.</p>

<p>To a young man ruled by high enthusiasms there
can be no more dazzling adventure than to work this
miracle in the tender creature who yields her mind to
his&mdash;to see, as it were, the blossoming of the spiritual
seed in forms of heightened loveliness, the bluer beam
of the eye, the richer curve of the lip, all the physical
currents of life quickening under the breath of a kindled
thought. It did not occur to him that any other emotion
had effected the change he perceived. Bessy Westmore
had in full measure that gift of unconscious hypocrisy
which enables a woman to make the man in whom
she is interested believe that she enters into all his
thoughts. She had&mdash;more than this&mdash;the gift of self-deception,
supreme happiness of the unreflecting nature,
whereby she was able to believe herself solely engrossed
in the subjects they discussed, to regard him as
the mere spokesman of important ideas, thus saving
their intercourse from present constraint, and from the
awkward contemplation of future contingencies. So,
in obedience to the ancient sorcery of life, these two
groped for and found each other in regions seemingly
so remote from the accredited domain of romance that
it would have been as a great surprise to them to learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[p 121]</a></span>
whither they had strayed as to see the arid streets of
Westmore suddenly bursting into leaf.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Westmore's departure Amherst, for the
first time, became aware of a certain flatness in his life.
His daily task seemed dull and purposeless, and he was
galled by Truscomb's studied forbearance, under which
he suspected a quickly accumulating store of animosity.
He almost longed for some collision which would release
the manager's pent-up resentment; yet he dreaded
increasingly any accident that might make his stay at
Westmore impossible.</p>

<p>It was on Sundays, when he was freed from his
weekly task, that he was most at the mercy of these
opposing feelings. They drove him forth on long solitary
walks beyond the town, walks ending most often
in the deserted grounds of Hopewood, beautiful now in
the ruined gold of October. As he sat under the beech-limbs
above the river, watching its brown current sweep
the willow-roots of the banks, he thought how this
same current, within its next short reach, passed from
wooded seclusion to the noise and pollution of the mills.
So his own life seemed to have passed once more from
the tranced flow of the last weeks into its old channel of
unillumined labour. But other thoughts came to him
too: the vision of converting that melancholy pleasure-ground
into an outlet for the cramped lives of the mill-workers;
and he pictured the weed-grown lawns and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[p 122]</a></span>
paths thronged with holiday-makers, and the slopes
nearer the factories dotted with houses and gardens.</p>

<p>An unexpected event revived these hopes. A few
days before Christmas it became known to Hanaford
that Mrs. Westmore would return for the holidays.
Cicely was drooping in town air, and Bessy had persuaded
Mr. Langhope that the bracing cold of Hanaford
would be better for the child than the milder atmosphere
of Long Island. They reappeared, and brought
with them a breath of holiday cheerfulness such as Westmore
had never known. It had always been the rule
at the mills to let the operatives take their pleasure as
they saw fit, and the Eldorado and the Hanaford saloons
throve on this policy. But Mrs. Westmore arrived full
of festal projects. There was to be a giant Christmas
tree for the mill-children, a supper on the same scale
for the operatives, and a bout of skating and coasting
at Hopewood for the older lads&mdash;the "band" and "bobbin"
boys in whom Amherst had always felt a special
interest. The Gaines ladies, resolved to show themselves
at home in the latest philanthropic fashions, actively
seconded Bessy's endeavours, and for a week
Westmore basked under a sudden heat-wave of beneficence.</p>

<p>The time had passed when Amherst might have made
light of such efforts. With Bessy Westmore smiling up,
holly-laden, from the foot of the ladder on which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[p 123]</a></span>
kept him perched, how could he question the efficacy
of hanging the opening-room with Christmas wreaths,
or the ultimate benefit of gorging the operatives with
turkey and sheathing their offspring in red mittens?
It was just like the end of a story-book with a pretty
moral, and Amherst was in the mood to be as much
taken by the tinsel as the youngest mill-baby held up to
gape at the tree.</p>

<p>At the New Year, when Mrs. Westmore left, the negotiations
for the purchase of the Eldorado were well
advanced, and it was understood that on their completion
she was to return for the opening of the night-school
and nursery. Suddenly, however, it became
known that the proprietor of the road-house had decided
not to sell. Amherst heard of the decision from
Duplain, and at once foresaw the inevitable result&mdash;that
Mrs. Westmore's plan would be given up owing
to the difficulty of finding another site. Mr. Gaines
and Truscomb had both discountenanced the erection
of a special building for what was, after all, only a
tentative enterprise. Among the purchasable houses
in Westmore no other was suited to the purpose, and
they had, therefore, a good excuse for advising Bessy
to defer her experiment.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time, however, another piece of
news changed the aspect of affairs. A scandalous occurrence
at the Eldorado, witnesses to which were un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[p 124]</a></span>expectedly
forthcoming, put it in Amherst's power to
threaten the landlord with exposure unless he should
at once accept the company's offer and withdraw from
Westmore. Amherst had no long time to consider the
best means of putting this threat into effect. He knew
it was not only idle to appeal to Truscomb, but essential
to keep the facts from him till the deed was done;
yet how obtain the authority to act without him? The
seemingly insuperable difficulties of the situation whetted
Amherst's craving for a struggle. He thought first
of writing to Mrs. Westmore;, but now that the spell of
her presence was withdrawn he felt how hard it would
be to make her understand the need of prompt and
secret action; and besides, was it likely that, at such
short notice, she could command the needful funds?
Prudence opposed the attempt, and on reflection he
decided to appeal to Mr. Gaines, hoping that the flagrancy
of the case would rouse the President from his
usual attitude of indifference.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaines was roused to the extent of showing a
profound resentment against the cause of his disturbance.
He relieved his sense of responsibility by some
didactic remarks on the vicious tendencies of the working-classes,
and concluded with the reflection that the
more you did for them the less thanks you got. But
when Amherst showed an unwillingness to let the matter
rest on this time-honoured aphorism, the President<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[p 125]</a></span>
retrenched himself behind ambiguities, suggestions that
they should await Mrs. Westmore's return, and general
considerations of a pessimistic nature, tapering off into
a gloomy view of the weather.</p>

<p>"By God, I'll write to her!" Amherst exclaimed, as
the Gaines portals closed on him; and all the way back
to Westmore he was busy marshalling his arguments
and entreaties.</p>

<p>He wrote the letter that night, but did not post it.
Some unavowed distrust of her restrained him&mdash;a distrust
not of her heart but of her intelligence. He felt
that the whole future of Westmore was at stake, and
decided to await the development of the next twenty-four
hours. The letter was still in his pocket when, after
dinner, he was summoned to the office by Truscomb.</p>

<p>That evening, when he returned home, he entered
the little sitting-room without speaking. His mother
sat there alone, in her usual place&mdash;how many nights
he had seen the lamplight slant at that particular angle
across her fresh cheek and the fine wrinkles about her
eyes! He was going to add another wrinkle to the
number now&mdash;soon they would creep down and encroach
upon the smoothness of the cheek.</p>

<p>She looked up and saw that his glance was turned to
the crowded bookshelves behind her.</p>

<p>"There must be nearly a thousand of them," he said
as their eyes met.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[p 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Books? Yes&mdash;with your father's. Why&mdash;were you
thinking...?" She started up suddenly and crossed
over to him.</p>

<p>"Too many for wanderers," he continued, drawing
her hands to his breast; then, as she clung to him,
weeping and trembling a little: "It had to be, mother,"
he said, kissing her penitently where the fine wrinkles
died into the cheek.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amherst's</span> dismissal was not to take effect for a
month; and in the interval he addressed himself
steadily to his task.</p>

<p>He went through the routine of the work numbly;
but his intercourse with the hands tugged at deep fibres
of feelings. He had always shared, as far as his duties
allowed, in the cares and interests of their few free
hours: the hours when the automatic appendages of
the giant machine became men and women again, with
desires and passions of their own. Under Amherst's
influence the mixed elements of the mill-community had
begun to crystallize into social groups: his books had
served as an improvised lending-library, he had organized
a club, a rudimentary orchestra, and various other
means of binding together the better spirits of the community.
With the older men, the attractions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[p 127]</a></span>
Eldorado, and kindred inducements, often worked
against him; but among the younger hands, and especially
the boys, he had gained a personal ascendency
that it was bitter to relinquish.</p>

<p>It was the severing of this tie that cost him most pain
in the final days at Westmore; and after he had done
what he could to console his mother, and to put himself
in the way of getting work elsewhere, he tried to see
what might be saved out of the ruins of the little polity
he had built up. He hoped his influence might at
least persist in the form of an awakened instinct of
fellowship; and he gave every spare hour to strengthening
the links he had tried to form. The boys, at any
rate, would be honestly sorry to have him go: not, indeed,
from the profounder reasons that affected him,
but because he had not only stood persistently between
the overseers and themselves, but had recognized their
right to fun after work-hours as well as their right to
protection while they worked.</p>

<p>In the glow of Mrs. Westmore's Christmas visitation
an athletic club had been formed, and leave obtained
to use the Hopewood grounds for Saturday afternoon
sports; and thither Amherst continued to conduct the
boys after the mills closed at the week-end. His last
Saturday had now come: a shining afternoon of late
February, with a red sunset bending above frozen river
and slopes of unruffled snow. For an hour or more he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[p 128]</a></span>
had led the usual sports, coasting down the steep descent
from the house to the edge of the woods, and
skating and playing hockey on the rough river-ice which
eager hands kept clear after every snow-storm. He
always felt the contagion of these sports: the glow of
movement, the tumult of young voices, the sting of the
winter air, roused all the boyhood in his blood. But
today he had to force himself through his part in the
performance. To the very last, as he now saw, he had
hoped for a sign in the heavens: not the reversal of
his own sentence&mdash;for, merely on disciplinary grounds,
he perceived that to be impossible&mdash;but something
pointing to a change in the management of the mills,
some proof that Mrs. Westmore's intervention had betokened
more than a passing impulse of compassion.
Surely she would not accept without question the abandonment
of her favourite scheme; and if she came
back to put the question, the answer would lay bare
the whole situation.... So Amherst's hopes had persuaded
him; but the day before he had heard that she
was to sail for Europe. The report, first announced
in the papers, had been confirmed by his mother, who
brought back from a visit to Hanaford the news that
Mrs. Westmore was leaving at once for an indefinite
period, and that the Hanaford house was to be closed.
Irony would have been the readiest caustic for the
wound inflicted; but Amherst, for that very reason, dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[p 129]</a></span>dained
it. He would not taint his disappointment with
mockery, but would leave it among the unspoiled sadnesses
of life....</p>

<p>He flung himself into the boys' sports with his
usual energy, meaning that their last Saturday with
him should be their merriest; but he went through his
part mechanically, and was glad when the sun began
to dip toward the rim of the woods.</p>

<p>He was standing on the ice, where the river widened
just below the house, when a jingle of bells broke on
the still air, and he saw a sleigh driven rapidly up the
avenue. Amherst watched it in surprise. Who, at
that hour, could be invading the winter solitude of
Hopewood? The sleigh halted near the closed house,
and a muffled figure, alighting alone, began to move
down the snowy slope toward the skaters.</p>

<p>In an instant he had torn off his skates and was bounding
up the bank. He would have known the figure anywhere&mdash;known
that lovely poise of the head, the mixture
of hesitancy and quickness in the light tread which even
the snow could not impede. Half-way up the slope to the
house they met, and Mrs. Westmore held out her hand.
Face and lips, as she stood above him, glowed with her
swift passage through the evening air, and in the blaze
of the sunset she seemed saturated with heavenly fires.</p>

<p>"I drove out to find you&mdash;they told me you were
here&mdash;I arrived this morning, quite suddenly...."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[p 130]</a></span></p>

<p>She broke off, as though the encounter had checked
her ardour instead of kindling it; but he drew no discouragement
from her tone.</p>

<p>"I hoped you would come before I left&mdash;I knew you
would!" he exclaimed; and at his last words her face
clouded anxiously.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were leaving Westmore till yesterday&mdash;the
day before&mdash;I got a letter...." Again she
wavered, perceptibly trusting her difficulty to him, in
the sweet way he had been trying to forget; and he
answered with recovered energy: "The great thing is
that you should be here."</p>

<p>She shook her head at his optimism. "What can I
do if you go?"</p>

<p>"You can give me a chance, before I go, to tell you
a little about some of the loose ends I am leaving."</p>

<p>"But why are you leaving them? I don't understand.
Is it inevitable?"</p>

<p>"Inevitable," he returned, with an odd glow of satisfaction
in the word; and as her eyes besought him, he
added, smiling: "I've been dismissed, you see; and
from the manager's standpoint I think I deserved it.
But the best part of my work needn't go with me&mdash;and
that is what I should like to speak to you about. As
assistant manager I can easily be replaced&mdash;have
been, I understand, already; but among these boys
here I should like to think that a little of me stayed&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[p 131]</a></span>
it will, if you'll let me tell you what I've been
doing."</p>

<p>She glanced away from him at the busy throng on
the ice and at the other black cluster above the coasting-slide.</p>

<p>"How they're enjoying it!" she murmured. "What
a pity it was never done before! And who will keep it
up when you're gone?"</p>

<p>"You," he answered, meeting her eyes again; and
as she coloured a little under his look he went on
quickly: "Will you come over and look at the coasting?
The time is almost up. One more slide and they'll be
packing off to supper."</p>

<p>She nodded "yes," and they walked in silence over
the white lawn, criss-crossed with tramplings of happy
feet, to the ridge from which the coasters started on
their run. Amherst's object in turning the talk had
been to gain a moment's respite. He could not bear
to waste his perfect hour in futile explanations: he
wanted to keep it undisturbed by any thought of the
future. And the same feeling seemed to possess his
companion, for she did not speak again till they reached
the knoll where the boys were gathered.</p>

<p>A sled packed with them hung on the brink: with a
last shout it was off, dipping down the incline with the
long curved flight of a swallow, flashing across the wide
meadow at the base of the hill, and tossed upward again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[p 132]</a></span>
by its own impetus, till it vanished in the dark rim of
wood on the opposite height. The lads waiting on the
knoll sang out for joy, and Bessy clapped her hands
and joined with them.</p>

<p>"What fun! I wish I'd brought Cicely! I've not
coasted for years," she laughed out, as the second detachment
of boys heaped themselves on another sled
and shot down. Amherst looked at her with a smile.
He saw that every other feeling had vanished in the
exhilaration of watching the flight of the sleds. She
had forgotten why she had come&mdash;forgotten her distress
at his dismissal&mdash;forgotten everything but the
spell of the long white slope, and the tingle of cold
in her veins.</p>

<p>"Shall we go down? Should you like it?" he asked,
feeling no resentment under the heightened glow of his
pulses.</p>

<p>"Oh, do take me&mdash;I shall love it!" Her eyes shone
like a child's&mdash;she might have been a lovelier embodiment
of the shouting boyhood about them.</p>

<p>The first band of coasters, sled at heels, had by this
time already covered a third of the homeward stretch;
but Amherst was too impatient to wait. Plunging
down to the meadow he caught up the sled-rope, and
raced back with the pack of rejoicing youth in his wake.
The sharp climb up the hill seemed to fill his lungs
with flame: his whole body burned with a strange in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[p 133]</a></span>tensity
of life. As he reached the top, a distant bell
rang across the fields from Westmore, and the boys
began to snatch up their coats and mufflers.</p>

<p>"Be off with you&mdash;I'll look after the sleds," Amherst
called to them as they dispersed; then he turned for a
moment to see that the skaters below were also heeding
the summons.</p>

<p>A cold pallor lay on the river-banks and on the low
meadow beneath the knoll; but the woodland opposite
stood black against scarlet vapours that ravelled off in
sheer light toward a sky hung with an icy moon.</p>

<p>Amherst drew up the sled and held it steady while
Bessy, seating herself, tucked her furs close with little
breaks of laughter; then he placed himself in front.</p>

<p>"Ready?" he cried over his shoulder, and "Ready!"
she called back.</p>

<p>Their craft quivered under them, hanging an instant
over the long stretch of whiteness below; the level
sun dazzled their eyes, and the first plunge seemed to
dash them down into darkness. Amherst heard a cry
of glee behind him; then all sounds were lost in the
whistle of air humming by like the flight of a million
arrows. They had dropped below the sunset and were
tearing through the clear nether twilight of the descent;
then, with a bound, the sled met the level, and shot
away across the meadow toward the opposite height.
It seemed to Amherst as though his body had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[p 134]</a></span>
left behind, and only the spirit in him rode the wild
blue currents of galloping air; but as the sled's rush
began to slacken with the strain of the last ascent he
was recalled to himself by the touch of the breathing
warmth at his back. Bessy had put out a hand to
steady herself, and as she leaned forward, gripping his
arm, a flying end of her furs swept his face. There was
a delicious pang in being thus caught back to life; and
as the sled stopped, and he sprang to his feet, he still
glowed with the sensation. Bessy too was under the
spell. In the dusk of the beech-grove where they had
landed, he could barely distinguish her features; but
her eyes shone on him, and he heard her quick breathing
as he stooped to help her to her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful&mdash;it's the only thing better than
a good gallop!"</p>

<p>She leaned against a tree-bole, panting a little, and
loosening her furs.</p>

<p>"What a pity it's too dark to begin again!" she
sighed, looking about her through the dim weaving of
leafless boughs.</p>

<p>"It's not so dark in the open&mdash;we might have one
more," he proposed; but she shook her head, seized
by a new whim.</p>

<p>"It's so still and delicious in here&mdash;did you hear the
snow fall when that squirrel jumped across to the pine?"
She tilted her head, narrowing her lids as she peered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[p 135]</a></span>
upward. "There he is! One gets used to the light....
Look! See his little eyes shining down at us!"</p>

<p>As Amherst looked where she pointed, the squirrel
leapt to another tree, and they stole on after him through
the hushed wood, guided by his grey flashes in the dimness.
Here and there, in a break of the snow, they
trod on a bed of wet leaves that gave out a breath of
hidden life, or a hemlock twig dashed its spicy scent
into their faces. As they grew used to the twilight
their eyes began to distinguish countless delicate gradations
of tint: cold mottlings of grey-black boles
against the snow, wet russets of drifted beech-leaves, a
distant network of mauve twigs melting into the woodland
haze. And in the silence just such fine gradations
of sound became audible: the soft drop of loosened
snow-lumps, a stir of startled wings, the creak of a
dead branch, somewhere far off in darkness.</p>

<p>They walked on, still in silence, as though they had
entered the glade of an enchanted forest and were
powerless to turn back or to break the hush with a
word. They made no pretense of following the squirrel
any longer; he had flashed away to a high tree-top,
from which his ironical chatter pattered down on their
unheeding ears. Amherst's sensations were not of that
highest order of happiness where mind and heart mingle
their elements in the strong draught of life: it was a
languid fume that stole through him from the cup at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[p 136]</a></span>
his lips. But after the sense of defeat and failure
which the last weeks had brought, the reaction was too
exquisite to be analyzed. All he asked of the moment
was its immediate sweetness....</p>

<p>They had reached the brink of a rocky glen where a
little brook still sent its thread of sound through mufflings
of ice and huddled branches. Bessy stood still a
moment, bending her head to the sweet cold tinkle; then
she moved away and said slowly: "We must go back."</p>

<p>As they turned to retrace their steps a yellow line of
light through the tree-trunks showed them that they
had not, after all, gone very deep into the wood. A few
minutes' walk would restore them to the lingering daylight,
and on the farther side of the meadow stood the
sleigh which was to carry Bessy back to Hanaford. A
sudden sense of the evanescence of the moment roused
Amherst from his absorption. Before the next change
in the fading light he would be back again among the
ugly realities of life. Did she, too, hate to return to
them? Or why else did she walk so slowly&mdash;why did
she seem as much afraid as himself to break the silence
that held them in its magic circle?</p>

<p>A dead pine-branch caught in the edge of her skirt,
and she stood still while Amherst bent down to release
her. As she turned to help him he looked up with a
smile.</p>

<p>"The wood doesn't want to let you go," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[p 137]</a></span></p>

<p>She made no reply, and he added, rising: "But you'll
come back to it&mdash;you'll come back often, I hope."</p>

<p>He could not see her face in the dimness, but her
voice trembled a little as she answered: "I will do
what you tell me&mdash;but I shall be alone&mdash;against all the
others: they don't understand."</p>

<p>The simplicity, the helplessness, of the avowal, appealed
to him not as a weakness but as a grace. He
understood what she was really saying: "How can you
desert me? How can you put this great responsibility
on me, and then leave me to bear it alone?" and in the
light of her unuttered appeal his action seemed almost
like cruelty. Why had he opened her eyes to wrongs
she had no strength to redress without his aid?</p>

<p>He could only answer, as he walked beside her toward
the edge of the wood: "You will not be alone&mdash;in time
you will make the others understand; in time they will
be with you."</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't believe that!" she exclaimed, pausing
suddenly, and speaking with an intensity of reproach
that amazed him.</p>

<p>"I hope it, at any rate," he rejoined, pausing also.
"And I'm sure that if you will come here oftener&mdash;if
you'll really live among your people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can you say that, when you're deserting them?"
she broke in, with a feminine excess of inconsequence
that fairly dashed the words from his lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[p 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Deserting them? Don't you understand&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I understand that you've made Mr. Gaines and
Truscomb angry&mdash;yes; but if I should insist on your
staying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amherst felt the blood rush to his forehead. "No&mdash;no,
it's not possible!" he exclaimed, with a vehemence
addressed more to himself than to her.</p>

<p>"Then what will happen at the mills?"</p>

<p>"Oh, some one else will be found&mdash;the new ideas are
stirring everywhere. And if you'll only come back here,
and help my successor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think they are likely to choose any one else
with your ideas?" she interposed with unexpected
acuteness; and after a short silence he answered: "Not
immediately, perhaps; but in time&mdash;in time there will
be improvements."</p>

<p>"As if the poor people could wait! Oh, it's cruel,
cruel of you to go!"</p>

<p>Her voice broke in a throb of entreaty that went to
his inmost fibres.</p>

<p>"You don't understand. It's impossible in the present
state of things that I should do any good by staying."</p>

<p>"Then you refuse? Even if I were to insist on
their asking you to stay, you would still refuse?" she
persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I should still refuse."</p>

<p>She made no answer, but moved a few steps nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[p 139]</a></span>
to the edge of the wood. The meadow was just below
them now, and the sleigh in plain sight on the height
beyond. Their steps made no sound on the sodden
drifts underfoot, and in the silence he thought he heard
a catch in her breathing. It was enough to make the
brimming moment overflow. He stood still before her
and bent his head to hers.</p>

<p>"Bessy!" he said, with sudden vehemence.</p>

<p>She did not speak or move, but in the quickened
state of his perceptions he became aware that she was
silently weeping. The gathering darkness under the
trees enveloped them. It absorbed her outline into the
shadowy background of the wood, from which her face
emerged in a faint spot of pallor; and the same obscurity
seemed to envelop his faculties, merging the
hard facts of life in a blur of feeling in which the distinctest
impression was the sweet sense of her tears.</p>

<p>"Bessy!" he exclaimed again; and as he drew a step
nearer he felt her yield to him, and bury her sobs
against his arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[p 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">But</span>, Justine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Harry Dressel, seated in the June freshness
of her Oak Street drawing-room, and harmonizing by
her high lights and hard edges with the white-and-gold
angularities of the best furniture, cast a rebuking
eye on her friend Miss Brent, who stood arranging in
a glass bowl the handful of roses she had just brought
in from the garden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel's intonation made it clear that the entrance
of Miss Brent had been the signal for renewing
an argument which the latter had perhaps left the
room to escape.</p>

<p>"When you were here three years ago, Justine, I
could understand your not wanting to go out, because
you were in mourning for your mother&mdash;and besides,
you'd volunteered for that bad surgical case in the Hope
Hospital. But now that you've come back for a rest
and a change I can't imagine why you persist in shutting
yourself up&mdash;unless, of course," she concluded, in
a higher key of reproach, "it's because you think so
little of Hanaford society&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[p 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine Brent, putting the last rose in place, turned
from her task with a protesting gesture.</p>

<p>"My dear Effie, who am I to think little of any society,
when I belong to none?" She passed a last
light touch over the flowers, and crossing the room,
brushed her friend's hand with the same caressing
gesture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel met it with an unrelenting turn of her
plump shoulder, murmuring: "Oh, if you take <i>that</i>
tone!" And on Miss Brent's gaily rejoining: "Isn't
it better than to have other people take it for me?"
she replied, with an air of affront that expressed itself
in a ruffling of her whole pretty person: "If you'll
excuse my saying so, Justine, the fact that you are staying
with <i>me</i> would be enough to make you welcome
anywhere in Hanaford!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, dear; so sure that my horrid pride
rather resents being floated in on the high tide of
such overwhelming credentials."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel glanced up doubtfully at the dark face
laughing down on her. Though she was president of
the Maplewood Avenue Book-club, and habitually
figured in the society column of the "Banner" as one
of the intellectual leaders of Hanaford, there were moments
when her self-confidence trembled before Justine's
light sallies. It was absurd, of course, given the
relative situations of the two; and Mrs. Dressel, behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[p 142]</a></span>
her friend's back, was quickly reassured by the thought
that Justine was only a hospital nurse, who had to
work for her living, and had really never "been anywhere";
but when Miss Brent's verbal arrows were
flying, it seemed somehow of more immediate consequence
that she was fairly well-connected, and lived in
New York. No one placed a higher value on the abstract
qualities of wit and irony than Mrs. Dressel; the
difficulty was that she never quite knew when Justine's
retorts were loaded, or when her own susceptibilities
were the target aimed at; and between her desire
to appear to take the joke, and the fear of being
ridiculed without knowing it, her pretty face often presented
an interesting study in perplexity. As usual,
she now took refuge in bringing the talk back to a
personal issue.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," she said, "why you won't go to
the Gaines's garden-party. It's always the most brilliant
affair of the season; and this year, with the John
Amhersts here, and all their party&mdash;that fascinating
Mrs. Eustace Ansell, and Mrs. Amherst's father, old
Mr. Langhope, who is quite as quick and clever as <i>you</i>
are&mdash;you certainly can't accuse us of being dull and
provincial!"</p>

<p>Miss Brent smiled. "As far as I can remember,
Effie, it is always you who accuse others of bringing
that charge against Hanaford. For my part, I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[p 143]</a></span>
too little of it to have formed any opinion; but whatever
it may have to offer me, I am painfully conscious of
having, at present, nothing but your kind commendation
to give in return."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel rose impatiently. "How absurdly you
talk! You're a little thinner than usual, and I don't
like those dark lines under your eyes; but Westy Gaines
told me yesterday that he thought you handsomer than
ever, and that it was intensely becoming to some women
to look over-tired."</p>

<p>"It's lucky I'm one of that kind," Miss Brent rejoined,
between a sigh and a laugh, "and there's every
promise of my getting handsomer every day if somebody
doesn't soon arrest the geometrical progression of
my good looks by giving me the chance to take a year's
rest!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, she stretched her arms above her head,
with a gesture revealing the suppleness of her slim
young frame, but also its tenuity of structure&mdash;the
frailness of throat and shoulders, and the play of bones
in the delicate neck. Justine Brent had one of those
imponderable bodies that seem a mere pinch of matter
shot through with light and colour. Though she did
not flush easily, auroral lights ran under her clear skin,
were lost in the shadows of her hair, and broke again
in her eyes; and her voice seemed to shoot light too,
as though her smile flashed back from her words as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[p 144]</a></span>
they fell&mdash;all her features being so fluid and changeful
that the one solid thing about her was the massing of
dense black hair which clasped her face like the noble
metal of some antique bust.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel's face softened at the note of weariness
in the girl's voice. "Are you very tired, dear?" she
asked drawing her down to a seat on the sofa.</p>

<p>"Yes, and no&mdash;not so much bodily, perhaps, as in
spirit." Justine Brent drew her brows together, and
stared moodily at the thin brown hands interwoven between
Mrs. Dressel's plump fingers. Seated thus, with
hollowed shoulders and brooding head, she might have
figured a young sibyl bowed above some mystery of
fate; but the next moment her face, inclining toward
her friend's, cast off its shadows and resumed the look
of a plaintive child.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is that I don't look forward with
any interest to taking up the old drudgery again. Of
course that loss of interest may be merely physical&mdash;I
should call it so in a nervous patient, no doubt. But
in myself it seems different&mdash;it seems to go to the roots
of the world. You know it was always the imaginative
side of my work that helped me over the ugly details&mdash;the
pity and beauty that disinfected the physical horror;
but now that feeling is lost, and only the mortal disgust
remains. Oh, Effie, I don't want to be a ministering
angel any more&mdash;I want to be uncertain, coy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[p 145]</a></span>
and hard to please. I want something dazzling and
unaccountable to happen to me&mdash;something new and
unlived and indescribable!"</p>

<p>She snatched herself with a laugh from the bewildered
Effie, and flinging up her arms again, spun on a light
heel across the polished floor.</p>

<p>"Well, then," murmured Mrs. Dressel with gentle
obstinacy, "I can't see why in the world you won't go
to the Gaines's garden-party!" And caught in the
whirlwind of her friend's incomprehensible mirth, she
still persisted, as she ducked her blonde head to it: "If
you'll only let me lend you my dress with the Irish lace,
you'll look smarter than anybody there...."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Before her toilet mirror, an hour later, Justine Brent
seemed in a way to fulfill Mrs. Dressel's prediction. So
mirror-like herself, she could no more help reflecting
the happy effect of a bow or a feather than the subtler
influence of word and look; and her face and figure
were so new to the advantages of dress that, at four-and-twenty,
she still produced the effect of a young girl
in her first "good" frock. In Mrs. Dressel's festal
raiment, which her dark tints subdued to a quiet elegance,
she was like the golden core of a pale rose illuminating
and scenting its petals.</p>

<p>Three years of solitary life, following on a youth of
confidential intimacy with the mother she had lost, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[p 146]</a></span>
produced in her the quaint habit of half-loud soliloquy.
"Fine feathers, Justine!" she laughed back at her
laughing image. "You look like a phoenix risen from
your ashes. But slip back into your own plumage, and
you'll be no more than a little brown bird without a
song!"</p>

<p>The luxurious suggestions of her dress, and the way
her warm youth became it, drew her back to memories
of a childhood nestled in beauty and gentle ways, before
her handsome prodigal father had died, and
her mother's face had grown pinched in the long
struggle with poverty. But those memories were after
all less dear to Justine than the grey years following,
when, growing up, she had helped to clear a space in
the wilderness for their tiny hearth-fire, when her own
efforts had fed the flame and roofed it in from the
weather. A great heat, kindled at that hearth, had
burned in her veins, making her devour her work,
lighting and warming the long cold days, and reddening
the horizon through dark passages of revolt and failure;
and she felt all the more deeply the chill of reaction that
set in with her mother's death.</p>

<p>She thought she had chosen her work as a nurse in
a spirit of high disinterestedness; but in the first hours
of her bereavement it seemed as though only the personal
aim had sustained her. For a while, after this,
her sick people became to her mere bundles of disin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[p 147]</a></span>tegrating
matter, and she shrank from physical pain
with a distaste the deeper because, mechanically, she
could not help working on to relieve it. Gradually her
sound nature passed out of this morbid phase, and she
took up her task with deeper pity if less exalted ardour;
glad to do her part in the vast impersonal labour of
easing the world's misery, but longing with all the warm
instincts of youth for a special load to lift, a single hand
to clasp.</p>

<p>Ah, it was cruel to be alive, to be young, to bubble
with springs of mirth and tenderness and folly, and to
live in perpetual contact with decay and pain&mdash;to look
persistently into the grey face of death without having
lifted even a corner of life's veil! Now and then, when
she felt her youth flame through the sheath of dullness
which was gradually enclosing it, she rebelled at the
conditions that tied a spirit like hers to its monotonous
task, while others, without a quiver of wings on their
dull shoulders, or a note of music in their hearts, had
the whole wide world to range through, and saw in it
no more than a frightful emptiness to be shut out with
tight walls of habit....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A tap on the door announced Mrs. Dressel, garbed for
conquest, and bestowing on her brilliant person the
last anxious touches of the artist reluctant to part from
a masterpiece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[p 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, how well you look! I <i>knew</i> that dress
would be becoming!" she exclaimed, generously transferring
her self-approval to Justine; and adding, as the
latter moved toward her: "I wish Westy Gaines could
see you now!"</p>

<p>"Well, he will presently," Miss Brent rejoined,
ignoring the slight stress on the name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel continued to brood on her maternally.
"Justine&mdash;I wish you'd tell me! You say you hate
the life you're leading now&mdash;but isn't there somebody
who might&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Give me another, with lace dresses in it?" Justine's
slight shrug might have seemed theatrical, had it
not been a part of the ceaseless dramatic play of her
flexible person. "There might be, perhaps...only
I'm not sure&mdash;" She broke off whimsically.</p>

<p>"Not sure of what?"</p>

<p>"That this kind of dress might not always be a little
tight on the shoulders."</p>

<p>"Tight on the shoulders? What do you mean, Justine?
My clothes simply <i>hang</i> on you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Effie dear, don't you remember the fable of the
wings under the skin, that sprout when one meets a
pair of kindred shoulders?" And, as Mrs. Dressel
bent on her a brow of unenlightenment&mdash;"Well, it
doesn't matter: I only meant that I've always been
afraid good clothes might keep my wings from sprout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[p 149]</a></span>ing!"
She turned back to the glass, giving herself a
last light touch such as she had bestowed on the roses.</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," she continued&mdash;"how about
Mr. Amherst's wings?"</p>

<p>"John Amherst?" Mrs. Dressel brightened into
immediate attention. "Why, do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Not as the owner of the Westmore Mills; but I
came across him as their assistant manager three years
ago, at the Hope Hospital, and he was starting a very
promising pair then. I wonder if they're doing as well
under his new coat."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I understand you when you talk
poetry," said Mrs. Dressel with less interest; "but personally
I can't say I like John Amherst&mdash;and he is certainly
not worthy of such a lovely woman as Mrs. Westmore.
Of course she would never let any one see that
she's not perfectly happy; but I'm told he has given
them all a great deal of trouble by interfering in the
management of the mills, and his manner is so cold and
sarcastic&mdash;the truth is, I suppose he's never quite at
ease in society. <i>Her</i> family have never been really reconciled
to the marriage; and Westy Gaines says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Westy Gaines <i>would</i>," Justine interposed lightly.
"But if Mrs. Amherst is really the Bessy Langhope I
used to know it must be rather a struggle for the wings!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel's flagging interest settled on the one
glimpse of fact in this statement. "It's such a coinci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[p 150]</a></span>dence
that you should have known her too! Was she
always so perfectly fascinating? I wish I knew how
she gives that look to her hair!"</p>

<p>Justine gathered up the lace sunshade and long
gloves which her friend had lent her. "There was not
much more that was genuine about her character&mdash;that
was her very own, I mean&mdash;than there is about my
appearance at this moment. She was always the dearest
little chameleon in the world, taking everybody's
colour in the most flattering way, and giving back, I
must say, a most charming reflection&mdash;if you'll excuse
the mixed metaphor; but when one got her by herself,
with no reflections to catch, one found she hadn't any
particular colour of her own. One of the girls used to
say she ought to wear a tag, because she was so easily
mislaid&mdash;&mdash; Now then, I'm ready!"</p>

<p>Justine advanced to the door, and Mrs. Dressel followed
her downstairs, reflecting with pardonable complacency
that one of the disadvantages of being clever
was that it tempted one to say sarcastic things of other
women&mdash;than which she could imagine no more crying
social error.</p>

<p>During the drive to the garden-party, Justine's
thoughts, drawn to the past by the mention of Bessy
Langhope's name, reverted to the comic inconsequences
of her own lot&mdash;to that persistent irrelevance of incident
that had once made her compare herself to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[p 151]</a></span>
actor always playing his part before the wrong stage-setting.
Was there not, for instance, a mocking incongruity
in the fact that a creature so leaping with
life should have, for chief outlet, the narrow mental
channel of the excellent couple between whom she was
now being borne to the Gaines garden-party? All her
friendships were the result of propinquity or of early
association, and fate had held her imprisoned in a circle
of well-to-do mediocrity, peopled by just such figures
as those of the kindly and prosperous Dressels. Effie
Dressel, the daughter of a cousin of Mrs. Brent's, had
obscurely but safely allied herself with the heavy blond
young man who was to succeed his father as President
of the Union Bank, and who was already regarded by
the "solid business interests" of Hanaford as possessing
talents likely to carry him far in the development
of the paternal fortunes. Harry Dressel's honest countenance
gave no evidence of peculiar astuteness, and he
was in fact rather the product of special conditions than
of an irresistible bent. He had the sound Saxon love
of games, and the most interesting game he had ever
been taught was "business." He was a simple domestic
being, and according to Hanaford standards the
most obvious obligation of the husband and father was
to make his family richer. If Harry Dressel had ever
formulated his aims, he might have said that he wanted
to be the man whom Hanaford most respected, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[p 152]</a></span>
that was only another way of saying, the richest man
in Hanaford. Effie embraced his creed with a zeal
facilitated by such evidence of its soundness as a growing
income and the early prospects of a carriage. Her
mother-in-law, a kind old lady with a simple unquestioning
love of money, had told her on her wedding day
that Harry's one object would always be to make his
family proud of him; and the recent purchase of the
victoria in which Justine and the Dressels were now
seated was regarded by the family as a striking fulfillment
of this prophecy.</p>

<p>In the course of her hospital work Justine had of
necessity run across far different types; but from the
connections thus offered she was often held back by
the subtler shades of taste that civilize human intercourse.
Her world, in short, had been chiefly peopled
by the dull or the crude, and, hemmed in between the
two, she had created for herself an inner kingdom where
the fastidiousness she had to set aside in her outward
relations recovered its full sway. There must be
actual beings worthy of admission to this secret precinct,
but hitherto they had not come her way; and the
sense that they were somewhere just out of reach still
gave an edge of youthful curiosity to each encounter
with a new group of people.</p>

<p>Certainly, Mrs. Gaines's garden-party seemed an unlikely
field for the exercise of such curiosity: Justine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[p 153]</a></span>
few glimpses of Hanaford society had revealed it as
rather a dull thick body, with a surface stimulated only
by ill-advised references to the life of larger capitals;
and the concentrated essence of social Hanaford was
of course to be found at the Gaines entertainments. It
presented itself, however, in the rich June afternoon,
on the long shadows of the well-kept lawn, and among
the paths of the rose-garden, in its most amiable aspect;
and to Justine, wearied by habitual contact with ugliness
and suffering, there was pure delight in the verdant
setting of the picture, and in the light harmonious tints
of the figures peopling it. If the company was dull,
it was at least decorative; and poverty, misery and dirt
were shut out by the placid unconsciousness of the
guests as securely as by the leafy barriers of the garden.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ah</span>, Mrs. Dressel, we were on the lookout for you&mdash;waiting
for the curtain to rise. Your friend Miss
Brent? Juliana, Mrs. Dressel's friend Miss Brent&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Near the brilliantly-striped marquee that formed the
axis of the Gaines garden-parties, Mr. Halford Gaines,
a few paces from his wife and daughters, stood radiating
a royal welcome on the stream of visitors pouring across
the lawn. It was only to eyes perverted by a different
social perspective that there could be any doubt as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[p 154]</a></span>
the importance of the Gaines entertainments. To
Hanaford itself they were epoch-making; and if any
rebellious spirit had cherished a doubt of the fact, it
would have been quelled by the official majesty of Mr.
Gaines's frock-coat and the comprehensive cordiality
of his manner.</p>

<p>There were moments when New York hung like a
disquieting cloud on the social horizon of Mrs. Gaines
and her daughters; but to Halford Gaines Hanaford
was all in all. As an exponent of the popular and
patriotic "good-enough-for-me" theory he stood in
high favour at the Hanaford Club, where a too-keen
consciousness of the metropolis was alternately combated
by easy allusion and studied omission, and where
the unsettled fancies of youth were chastened and
steadied by the reflection that, if Hanaford was good
enough for Halford Gaines, it must offer opportunities
commensurate with the largest ideas of life.</p>

<p>Never did Mr. Gaines's manner bear richer witness
to what could be extracted from Hanaford than when
he was in the act of applying to it the powerful pressure
of his hospitality. The resultant essence was so bubbling
with social exhilaration that, to its producer at
any rate, its somewhat mixed ingredients were lost in
one highly flavoured draught. Under ordinary circumstances
no one discriminated more keenly than Mr.
Gaines between different shades of social importance;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[p 155]</a></span>
but any one who was entertained by him was momentarily
ennobled by the fact, and not all the anxious
telegraphy of his wife and daughters could, for instance,
recall to him that the striking young woman in Mrs.
Dressel's wake was only some obscure prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, whom
it was odd of Effie to have brought, and whose presence
was quite unnecessary to emphasize.</p>

<p>"Juliana, Miss Brent tells me she has never seen our
roses. Oh, there are other roses in Hanaford, Miss
Brent; I don't mean to imply that no one else attempts
them; but unless you can afford to give <i>carte blanche</i>
to your man&mdash;and mine happens to be something of
a specialist...well, if you'll come with me, I'll let
them speak for themselves. I always say that if
people want to know what we can do they must come
and see&mdash;they'll never find out from <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>A more emphatic signal from his wife arrested Mr.
Gaines as he was in the act of leading Miss Brent away.</p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;What? The Amhersts and Mrs. Ansell?
You must excuse me then, I'm afraid&mdash;but Westy shall
take you. Westy, my boy, it's an ill-wind.... I want
you to show this young lady our roses." And Mr.
Gaines, with mingled reluctance and satisfaction, turned
away to receive the most important guests of the day.</p>

<p>It had not needed his father's summons to draw the
expert Westy to Miss Brent: he was already gravitating
toward her, with the nonchalance bred of cosmopolitan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[p 156]</a></span>
successes, but with a directness of aim due also to his
larger opportunities of comparison.</p>

<p>"The roses will do," he explained, as he guided her
through the increasing circle of guests about his mother;
and in answer to Justine's glance of enquiry: "To get
you away, I mean. They're not much in themselves,
you know; but everything of the governor's always
begins with a capital letter."</p>

<p>"Oh, but these roses deserve to," Justine exclaimed,
as they paused under the evergreen archway at the
farther end of the lawn.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;not if you've been in England,"
Westy murmured, watching furtively for the impression
produced, on one who had presumably not, by
the great blush of colour massed against its dusky
background of clipped evergreens.</p>

<p>Justine smiled. "I <i>have</i> been&mdash;but I've been in the
slums since; in horrible places that the least of those
flowers would have lighted up like a lamp."</p>

<p>Westy's guarded glance imprudently softened. "It's
the beastliest kind of a shame, your ever having had
to do such work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>had</i> to?" she flashed back at him disconcertingly.
"It was my choice, you know: there was a
time when I couldn't live without it. Philanthropy is
one of the subtlest forms of self-indulgence."</p>

<p>Westy met this with a vague laugh. If a chap who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[p 157]</a></span>
was as knowing as the devil <i>did</i>, once in a way, indulge
himself in the luxury of talking recklessly to a
girl with exceptional eyes, it was rather upsetting to
discover in those eyes no consciousness of the risk he
had taken!</p>

<p>"But I <i>am</i> rather tired of it now," she continued, and
his look grew guarded again. After all, they were all
the same&mdash;except in that particular matter of the eyes.
At the thought, he risked another look, hung on the
sharp edge of betrayal, and was snatched back, not by
the manly instinct of self-preservation, but by some
imp of mockery lurking in the depths that lured him.</p>

<p>He recovered his balance and took refuge in a tone
of worldly ease. "I saw a chap the other day who
said he knew you when you were at Saint Elizabeth's&mdash;wasn't
that the name of your hospital?"</p>

<p>Justine assented. "One of the doctors, I suppose.
Where did you meet him?"</p>

<p>Ah, <i>now</i> she should see! He summoned his utmost
carelessness of tone. "Down on Long Island last week&mdash;I
was spending Sunday with the Amhersts." He
held up the glittering fact to her, and watched for the
least little blink of awe; but her lids never trembled.
It was a confession of social blindness which painfully
negatived Mrs. Dressel's hint that she knew the Amhersts;
if she had even known <i>of</i> them, she could not
so fatally have missed his point.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[p 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Long Island?" She drew her brows together in
puzzled retrospection. "I wonder if it could have been
Stephen Wyant? I heard he had taken over his uncle's
practice somewhere near New York."</p>

<p>"Wyant&mdash;that's the name. He's the doctor at Clifton,
the nearest town to the Amhersts' place. Little
Cicely had a cold&mdash;Cicely Westmore, you know&mdash;a
small cousin of mine, by the way&mdash;" he switched a rose-branch
loftily out of her path, explaining, as she moved
on, that Cicely was the daughter of Mrs. Amherst's
first marriage to Richard Westmore. "That's the way
I happened to see this Dr. Wyant. Bessy&mdash;Mrs. Amherst&mdash;asked
him to stop to luncheon, after he'd seen
the kid. He seems rather a discontented sort of a
chap&mdash;grumbling at not having a New York practice.
I should have thought he had rather a snug berth, down
there at Lynbrook, with all those swells to dose."</p>

<p>Justine smiled. "Dr. Wyant is ambitious, and swells
don't have as interesting diseases as poor people. One
gets tired of giving them bread pills for imaginary ailments.
But Dr. Wyant is not strong himself and I
fancy a country practice is better for him than hard
work in town."</p>

<p>"You think him clever though, do you?" Westy enquired
absently. He was already bored with the subject
of the Long Island doctor, and vexed at the lack
of perception that led his companion to show more con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[p 159]</a></span>cern
in the fortunes of a country practitioner than in
the fact of his own visit to the Amhersts; but the topic
was a safe one, and it was agreeable to see how her
face kindled when she was interested.</p>

<p>Justine mused on his question. "I think he has very
great promise&mdash;which he is almost certain not to fulfill,"
she answered with a sigh which seemed to Westy's
anxious ear to betray a more than professional interest
in the person referred to.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now&mdash;why not? With the Amhersts to
give him a start&mdash;I heard my cousin recommending him
to a lot of people the other day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he may become a fashionable doctor," Justine
assented indifferently; to which her companion rejoined,
with a puzzled stare: "That's just what I mean&mdash;with
Bessy backing him!"</p>

<p>"Has Mrs. Amherst become such a power, then?"
Justine asked, taking up the coveted theme just as he
despaired of attracting her to it.</p>

<p>"My cousin?" he stretched the two syllables to the
cracking-point. "Well, she's awfully rich, you know;
and there's nobody smarter. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; it's so long since I've seen her."</p>

<p>He brightened. "You <i>did</i> know her, then?" But the
discovery made her obtuseness the more inexplicable!</p>

<p>"Oh, centuries ago: in another world."</p>

<p>"<i>Centuries</i>&mdash;I like that!" Westy gallantly protested,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[p 160]</a></span>
his ardour kindling as she swam once more within his
social ken. "And Amherst? You know him too, I
suppose? By Jove, here he is now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He signalled a tall figure strolling slowly toward
them with bent head and brooding gaze. Justine's eye
had retained a vivid image of the man with whom,
scarcely three years earlier, she had lived through a
moment of such poignant intimacy, and she recognized
at once his lean outline, and the keen spring of his
features, still veiled by the same look of inward absorption.
She noticed, as he raised his hat in response to
Westy Gaines's greeting, that the vertical lines between
his brows had deepened; and a moment later she was
aware that this change was the visible token of others
which went deeper than the fact of his good clothes and
his general air of leisure and well-being&mdash;changes perceptible
to her only in the startled sense of how prosperity
had aged him.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Amherst&mdash;trying to get under cover?" Westy
jovially accosted him, with a significant gesture toward
the crowded lawn from which the new-comer had evidently
fled. "I was just telling Miss Brent that this
is the safest place on these painful occasions&mdash;Oh, confound
it, it's not as safe as I thought! Here's one of
my sisters making for me!"</p>

<p>There ensued a short conflict of words, before his
feeble flutter of resistance was borne down by a resolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[p 161]</a></span>
Miss Gaines who, as she swept him back to the marquee,
cried out to Amherst that her mother was asking
for him too; and then Justine had time to observe
that her remaining companion had no intention of
responding to his hostess's appeal.</p>

<p>Westy, in naming her, had laid just enough stress on
the name to let it serve as a reminder or an introduction,
as circumstances might decide, and she saw that Amherst,
roused from his abstraction by the proffered clue,
was holding his hand out doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I think we haven't met for some years," he said.</p>

<p>Justine smiled. "I have a better reason than you
for remembering the exact date;" and in response to
his look of surprise she added: "You made me commit
a professional breach of faith, and I've never known
since whether to be glad or sorry."</p>

<p>Amherst still bent on her the gaze which seemed to
find in external details an obstacle rather than a help
to recognition; but suddenly his face cleared. "It was
you who told me the truth about poor Dillon! I
couldn't imagine why I seemed to see you in such a
different setting...."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm disguised as a lady this afternoon," she said
smiling. "But I'm glad you saw through the disguise."</p>

<p>He smiled back at her. "Are you? Why?"</p>

<p>"It seems to make it&mdash;if it's so transparent&mdash;less of
a sham, less of a dishonesty," she began impulsively,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[p 162]</a></span>
and then paused again, a little annoyed at the overemphasis
of her words. Why was she explaining and
excusing herself to this stranger? Did she propose to
tell him next that she had borrowed her dress from
Effie Dressel? To cover her confusion she went on
with a slight laugh: "But you haven't told me."</p>

<p>"What was I to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Whether to be glad or sorry that I broke my vow
and told the truth about Dillon."</p>

<p>They were standing face to face in the solitude of
the garden-walk, forgetful of everything but the sudden
surprised sense of intimacy that had marked their
former brief communion. Justine had raised her eyes
half-laughingly to Amherst, but they dropped before
the unexpected seriousness of his.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know?" he asked.</p>

<p>She made an effort to sustain the note of pleasantry.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it might, for instance, determine my future
conduct. You see I'm still a nurse, and such problems
are always likely to present themselves."</p>

<p>"Ah, then don't!"</p>

<p>"Don't?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;" He hesitated a moment, reaching up
to break a rose from the branch that tapped his shoulder.
"I was only thinking what risks we run when we scramble
into the chariot of the gods and try to do the driving.
Be passive&mdash;be passive, and you'll be happier!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[p 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, as to that&mdash;!" She swept it aside with one of
her airy motions. "But Dillon, for instance&mdash;would <i>he</i>
have been happier if I'd been passive?"</p>

<p>Amherst seemed to ponder. "There again&mdash;how
can one tell?"</p>

<p>"And the risk's not worth taking?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>She paused, and they looked at each other again.
"Do you mean that seriously, I wonder? Do you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Act on it myself? God forbid! The gods drive
so badly. There's poor Dillon...he happened to
be in their way...as we all are at times." He
pulled himself up, and went on in a matter-of-fact tone:
"In Dillon's case, however, my axioms don't apply.
When my wife heard the truth she was, of course, immensely
kind to him; and if it hadn't been for you she
might never have known."</p>

<p>Justine smiled. "I think you would have found out&mdash;I
was only the humble instrument. But now&mdash;" she
hesitated&mdash;"now you must be able to do so much&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amherst lifted his head, and she saw the colour rise
under his fair skin. "Out at Westmore? You've
never been there since? Yes&mdash;my wife has made some
changes; but it's all so problematic&mdash;and one would
have to live here...."</p>

<p>"You don't, then?"</p>

<p>He answered by an imperceptible shrug. "Of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[p 164]</a></span>
I'm here often; and she comes now and then. But the
journey's tiresome, and it is not always easy for her to
get away." He checked himself, and Justine saw that
he, in turn, was suddenly conscious of the incongruity
of explaining and extenuating his personal situation to
a stranger. "But then we're <i>not</i> strangers!" a voice
in her exulted, just as he added, with an embarrassed
attempt to efface and yet justify his moment of expansion:
"That reminds me&mdash;I think you know my wife.
I heard her asking Mrs. Dressel about you. She wants
so much to see you."</p>

<p>The transition had been effected, at the expense of
dramatic interest, but to the obvious triumph of social
observances; and to Justine, after all, regaining at his
side the group about the marquee, the interest was not
so much diminished as shifted to the no less suggestive
problem of studying the friend of her youth in the unexpected
character of John Amherst's wife.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, during the brief transit across
the Gaines greensward, her thoughts were still busy
with Amherst. She had seen at once that the peculiar
sense of intimacy reawakened by their meeting had
been chilled and deflected by her first allusion to the
topic which had previously brought them together:
Amherst had drawn back as soon as she named the
mills. What could be the cause of his reluctance?
When they had last met, the subject burned within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[p 165]</a></span>
him: her being in actual fact a stranger had not, then,
been an obstacle to his confidences. Now that he was
master at Westmore it was plain that another tone
became him&mdash;that his situation necessitated a greater
reserve; but her enquiry did not imply the least wish
to overstep this restriction: it merely showed her remembrance
of his frankly-avowed interest in the operatives.
Justine was struck by the fact that so natural
an allusion should put him on the defensive. She did
not for a moment believe that he had lost his interest
in the mills; and that his point of view should have
shifted with the fact of ownership she rejected as an
equally superficial reading of his character. The man
with whom she had talked at Dillon's bedside was one
in whom the ruling purposes had already shaped themselves,
and to whom life, in whatever form it came,
must henceforth take their mould. As she reached this
point in her analysis, it occurred to her that his shrinking
from the subject might well imply not indifference,
but a deeper preoccupation: a preoccupation for some
reason suppressed and almost disavowed, yet sustaining
the more intensely its painful hidden life. From this
inference it was but a leap of thought to the next&mdash;that
the cause of the change must be sought outside of
himself, in some external influence strong enough to
modify the innate lines of his character. And where
could such an influence be more obviously sought than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[p 166]</a></span>
in the marriage which had transformed the assistant
manager of the Westmore Mills not, indeed, into their
owner&mdash;that would rather have tended to simplify the
problem&mdash;but into the husband of Mrs. Westmore?
After all, the mills were Bessy's&mdash;and for a farther
understanding of the case it remained to find out what
manner of person Bessy had become.</p>

<p>Justine's first impression, as her friend's charming
arms received her&mdash;with an eagerness of welcome not
lost on the suspended judgment of feminine Hanaford&mdash;the
immediate impression was of a gain of emphasis,
of individuality, as though the fluid creature she remembered
had belied her prediction, and run at last
into a definite mould. Yes&mdash;Bessy had acquired an
outline: a graceful one, as became her early promise,
though with, perhaps, a little more sharpness of edge
than her youthful texture had promised. But the side
she turned to her friend was still all softness&mdash;had in it
a hint of the old pliancy, the impulse to lean and enlace,
that at once woke in Justine the corresponding
instinct of guidance and protection, so that their first
kiss, before a word was spoken, carried the two back
to the precise relation in which their school-days had
left them. So easy a reversion to the past left no room
for the sense of subsequent changes by which such
reunions are sometimes embarrassed. Justine's sympathies
had, instinctively, and almost at once, transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[p 167]</a></span>
themselves to Bessy's side&mdash;passing over at a leap the
pained recognition that there <i>were</i> sides already&mdash;and
Bessy had gathered up Justine into the circle of gentle
self-absorption which left her very dimly aware of any
distinctive characteristic in her friends except that of
their affection for herself&mdash;since she asked only, as
she appealingly put it, that they should all be "dreadfully
fond" of her.</p>

<p>"And I've wanted you so often, Justine: you're the
only clever person I'm not afraid of, because your
cleverness always used to make things clear instead of
confusing them. I've asked so many people about
you&mdash;but I never heard a word till just the other day&mdash;wasn't
it odd?&mdash;when our new doctor at Rushton happened
to say that he knew you. I've been rather unwell
lately&mdash;nervous and tired, and sleeping badly&mdash;and
he told me I ought to keep perfectly quiet, and be
under the care of a nurse who could make me do as
she chose: just such a nurse as a wonderful Miss Brent
he had known at St. Elizabeth's, whose patients obeyed
her as if she'd been the colonel of a regiment. His description
made me laugh, it reminded me so much of
the way you used to make me do what you wanted at
the convent&mdash;and then it suddenly occurred to me that
I had heard of you having gone in for nursing, and we
compared notes, and I found it was really you! Wasn't
it odd that we should discover each other in that way?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[p 168]</a></span>
I daresay we might have passed in the street and never
known it&mdash;I'm sure I must be horribly changed...."</p>

<p>Thus Bessy discoursed, in the semi-isolation to
which, under an overarching beech-tree, the discretion
of their hostess had allowed the two friends to withdraw
for the freer exchange of confidences. There was, at
first sight, nothing in her aspect to bear out Mrs. Amherst's
plaintive allusion to her health, but Justine,
who knew that she had lost a baby a few months previously,
assumed that the effect of this shock still lingered,
though evidently mitigated by a reviving interest
in pretty clothes and the other ornamental accessories
of life. Certainly Bessy Amherst had grown into the
full loveliness which her childhood promised. She had
the kind of finished prettiness that declares itself early,
holds its own through the awkward transitions of girlhood,
and resists the strain of all later vicissitudes, as
though miraculously preserved in some clear medium
impenetrable to the wear and tear of living.</p>

<p>"You absurd child! You've not changed a bit except
to grow more so!" Justine laughed, paying
amused tribute to the childish craving for "a compliment"
that still betrayed itself in Bessy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> have, then, Justine&mdash;you've grown extraordinarily
handsome!"</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> extraordinary of me, certainly," the other
acknowledged gaily. "But then think what room for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[p 169]</a></span>
improvement there was&mdash;and how much time I've had
to improve in!"</p>

<p>"It is a long time, isn't it?" Bessy assented. "I
feel so intimate, still, with the old Justine of the convent,
and I don't know the new one a bit. Just think&mdash;I've
a great girl of my own, almost as old as we were
when we went to the Sacred Heart: But perhaps you
don't know anything about me either. You see, I
married again two years ago, and my poor baby
died last March...so I have only Cicely. It was
such a disappointment&mdash;I wanted a boy dreadfully,
and I understand little babies so much better than
a big girl like Cicely.... Oh, dear, here is Juliana
Gaines bringing up some more tiresome people! It's
such a bore, but John says I must know them all. Well,
thank goodness we've only one more day in this dreadful
place&mdash;and of course I shall see you, dear, before
we go...."</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> conducting Miss Brent to his wife, John
Amherst, by the exercise of considerable strategic
skill, had once more contrived to detach himself from
the throng on the lawn, and, regaining a path in the
shrubbery, had taken refuge on the verandah of the
house.</p>

<p>Here, under the shade of the awning, two ladies were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[p 170]</a></span>
seated in a seclusion agreeably tempered by the distant
strains of the Hanaford band, and by the shifting prospect
of the groups below them.</p>

<p>"Ah, here he is now!" the younger of the two exclaimed,
turning on Amherst the smile of intelligence
that Mrs. Eustace Ansell was in the habit of substituting
for the idle preliminaries of conversation. "We
were not talking of you, though," she added as Amherst
took the seat to which his mother beckoned him,
"but of Bessy&mdash;which, I suppose, is almost as indiscreet."</p>

<p>She added the last phrase after an imperceptible
pause, and as if in deprecation of the hardly more perceptible
frown which, at the mention of his wife's name,
had deepened the lines between Amherst's brows.</p>

<p>"Indiscreet of his own mother and his wife's friend?"
Mrs. Amherst protested, laying her trimly-gloved hand
on her son's arm; while the latter, with his eyes on
her companion, said slowly: "Mrs. Ansell knows that
indiscretion is the last fault of which her friends are
likely to accuse her."</p>

<p>"<i>Raison de plus</i>, you mean?" she laughed, meeting
squarely the challenge that passed between them under
Mrs. Amherst's puzzled gaze. "Well, if I take advantage
of my reputation for discretion to meddle a little
now and then, at least I do so in a good cause. I was
just saying how much I wish that you would take Bessy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[p 171]</a></span>
to Europe; and I am so sure of my cause, in this case,
that I am going to leave it to your mother to give you
my reasons."</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, not with any sign of haste or
embarrassment, but as if gracefully recognizing the
desire of mother and son to be alone together; but
Amherst, rising also, made a motion to detain her.</p>

<p>"No one else will be able to put your reasons half so
convincingly," he said with a slight smile, "and I am sure
my mother would much rather be spared the attempt."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell met the smile as freely as she had met
the challenge. "My dear Lucy," she rejoined, laying,
as she reseated herself, a light caress on Mrs. Amherst's
hand, "I'm sorry to be flattered at your expense, but
it's not in human nature to resist such an appeal. You
see," she added, raising her eyes to Amherst, "how sure
I am of myself&mdash;and of <i>you</i>, when you've heard me."</p>

<p>"Oh, John is always ready to hear one," his mother
murmured innocently.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I shall even ask him to do
as much as that&mdash;I'm so sure, after all, that my suggestion
carries its explanation with it."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, during which Amherst
let his eyes wander absently over the dissolving groups
on the lawn.</p>

<p>"The suggestion that I should take Bessy to Europe?"
He paused again. "When&mdash;next autumn?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[p 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"No: now&mdash;at once. On a long honeymoon."</p>

<p>He frowned slightly at the last word, passing it by to
revert to the direct answer to his question.</p>

<p>"At once? No&mdash;I can't see that the suggestion
carries its explanation with it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell looked at him hesitatingly. She was
conscious of the ill-chosen word that still reverberated
between them, and the unwonted sense of having blundered
made her, for the moment, less completely mistress
of herself.</p>

<p>"Ah, you'll see farther presently&mdash;" She rose again,
unfurling her lace sunshade, as if to give a touch of
definiteness to her action. "It's not, after all," she
added, with a sweet frankness, "a case for argument,
and still less for persuasion. My reasons are excellent&mdash;I
should insist on putting them to you myself if they
were not! But they're so good that I can leave you to
find them out&mdash;and to back them up with your own,
which will probably be a great deal better."</p>

<p>She summed up with a light nod, which included both
Amherst and his mother, and turning to descend the
verandah steps, waved a signal to Mr. Langhope, who
was limping disconsolately toward the house.</p>

<p>"What has she been saying to you, mother?"
Amherst asked, returning to his seat beside his
mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst replied by a shake of her head and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[p 173]</a></span>
raised forefinger of reproval. "Now, Johnny, I won't
answer a single question till you smooth out those lines
between your eyes."</p>

<p>Her son relaxed his frown to smile back at her.
"Well, dear, there have to be some wrinkles in every
family, and as you absolutely refuse to take your
share&mdash;" His eyes rested affectionately on the frosty
sparkle of her charming old face, which had, in its
setting of recovered prosperity, the freshness of a sunny
winter morning, when the very snow gives out a suggestion
of warmth.</p>

<p>He remembered how, on the evening of his dismissal
from the mills, he had paused on the threshold of their
sitting-room to watch her a moment in the lamplight,
and had thought with bitter compunction of the fresh
wrinkle he was about to add to the lines about her eyes.
The three years which followed had effaced that wrinkle
and veiled the others in a tardy bloom of well-being.
From the moment of turning her back on Westmore,
and establishing herself in the pretty little house at
Hanaford which her son's wife had placed at her disposal,
Mrs. Amherst had shed all traces of the difficult
years; and the fact that his marriage had enabled him
to set free, before it was too late, the pent-up springs
of her youthfulness, sometimes seemed to Amherst the
clearest gain in his life's confused total of profit and
loss. It was, at any rate, the sense of Bessy's share in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[p 174]</a></span>
the change that softened his voice when he spoke of
her to his mother.</p>

<p>"Now, then, if I present a sufficiently unruffled surface,
let us go back to Mrs. Ansell&mdash;for I confess that
her mysterious reasons are not yet apparent to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst looked deprecatingly at her son.
"Maria Ansell is devoted to you too, John&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course she is! It's her <i>r&ocirc;le</i> to be devoted to
everybody&mdash;especially to her enemies."</p>

<p>"Her enemies?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't intend any personal application. But
why does she want me to take Bessy abroad?"</p>

<p>"She and Mr. Langhope think that Bessy is not
looking well."</p>

<p>Amherst paused, and the frown showed itself for a
moment. "What do <i>you</i> think, mother?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed it myself: Bessy seems to me
prettier than ever. But perhaps she has less colour&mdash;and
she complains of not sleeping. Maria thinks she
still frets over the baby."</p>

<p>Amherst made an impatient gesture. "Is Europe
the only panacea?"</p>

<p>"You should consider, John, that Bessy is used to
change and amusement. I think you sometimes forget
that other people haven't your faculty of absorbing
themselves in a single interest. And Maria says that
the new doctor at Clifton, whom they seem to think so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[p 175]</a></span>
clever, is very anxious that Bessy should go to Europe
this summer."</p>

<p>"No doubt; and so is every one else: I mean her
father and old Tredegar&mdash;and your friend Mrs. Ansell
not least."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst lifted her bright black eyes to his.
"Well, then&mdash;if they all think she needs it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, if travel were what she needed!&mdash;Why,
we've never stopped travelling since we married.
We've been everywhere on the globe except at Hanaford&mdash;this
is her second visit here in three years!" He
rose and took a rapid turn across the deserted verandah.
"It's not because her health requires it&mdash;it's to get me
away from Westmore, to prevent things being done
there that ought to be done!" he broke out vehemently,
halting again before his mother.</p>

<p>The aged pink faded from Mrs. Amherst's face,
but her eyes retained their lively glitter. "To prevent
things being done? What a strange thing to
say!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have said it if I hadn't seen you falling
under Mrs. Ansell's spell."</p>

<p>His mother had a gesture which showed from whom
he had inherited his impulsive movements. "Really,
my son&mdash;!" She folded her hands, and added after a
pause of self-recovery: "If you mean that I have ever
attempted to interfere&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[p 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no: but when they pervert things so damnably&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John!"</p>

<p>He dropped into his chair again, and pushed the hair
from his forehead with a groan.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;put it that they have as much right to
their view as I have: I only want you to see what it is.
Whenever I try to do anything at Westmore&mdash;to give a
real start to the work that Bessy and I planned together&mdash;some
pretext is found to stop it: to pack us off to
the ends of the earth, to cry out against reducing her
income, to encourage her in some new extravagance to
which the work at the mills must be sacrificed!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst, growing pale under this outbreak, assured
herself by a nervous backward glance that their
privacy was still uninvaded; then her eyes returned
to her son's face.</p>

<p>"John&mdash;are you sure you're not sacrificing your wife
to the mills?"</p>

<p>He grew pale in turn, and they looked at each other
for a moment without speaking.</p>

<p>"You see it as they do, then?" he rejoined with a
discouraged sigh.</p>

<p>"I see it as any old woman would, who had my experiences
to look back to."</p>

<p>"Mother!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She smiled composedly. "Do you think I mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[p 177]</a></span>
that as a reproach? That's because men will never
understand women&mdash;least of all, sons their mothers.
No real mother wants to come first; she puts her son's
career ahead of everything. But it's different with a
wife&mdash;and a wife as much in love as Bessy."</p>

<p>Amherst looked away. "I should have thought that
was a reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would reconcile her to being set aside, to
counting only second in your plans?"</p>

<p>"They were <i>her</i> plans when we married!"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear&mdash;!" She paused on that, letting her
shrewd old glance, and all the delicate lines of experience
in her face, supply what farther comment the
ineptitude of his argument invited.</p>

<p>He took the full measure of her meaning, receiving it
in a baffled silence that continued as she rose and gathered
her lace mantle about her, as if to signify that
their confidences could not, on such an occasion, be
farther prolonged without singularity. Then he stood
up also and joined her, resting his hand on hers while
she leaned on the verandah rail.</p>

<p>"Poor mother! And I've kept you to myself all this
time, and spoiled your good afternoon."</p>

<p>"No, dear; I was a little tired, and had slipped away
to be quiet." She paused, and then went on, persuasively
giving back his pressure: "I know how you
feel about doing your duty, John; but now that things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[p 178]</a></span>
are so comfortably settled, isn't it a pity to unsettle
them?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Amherst had intended, on leaving his mother, to rejoin
Bessy, whom he could still discern, on the lawn, in absorbed
communion with Miss Brent; but after what
had passed it seemed impossible, for the moment, to recover
the garden-party tone, and he made his escape
through the house while a trio of Cuban singers, who
formed the crowning number of the entertainment,
gathered the company in a denser circle about their
guitars.</p>

<p>As he walked on aimlessly under the deep June
shadows of Maplewood Avenue his mother's last words
formed an ironical accompaniment to his thoughts.
"Now that things are comfortably settled&mdash;" he knew
so well what that elastic epithet covered! Himself, for
instance, ensconced in the impenetrable prosperity of
his wonderful marriage; herself too (unconsciously,
dear soul!), so happily tucked away in a cranny of that
new and spacious life, and no more able to conceive
why existing conditions should be disturbed than the
bird in the eaves understands why the house should be
torn down. Well&mdash;he had learned at last what his experience
with his poor, valiant, puzzled mother might
have taught him: that one must never ask from women
any view but the personal one, any measure of conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[p 179]</a></span>
but that of their own pains and pleasures. She, indeed,
had borne undauntedly enough the brunt of their
earlier trials; but that was merely because, as she said,
the mother's instinct bade her heap all her private
hopes on the great devouring altar of her son's ambition;
it was not because she had ever, in the very least,
understood or sympathized with his aims.</p>

<p>And Bessy&mdash;? Perhaps if their little son had lived
she might in turn have obeyed the world-old instinct of
self-effacement&mdash;but now! He remembered with an
intenser self-derision that, not even in the first surprise
of his passion, had he deluded himself with the idea
that Bessy Westmore was an exception to her sex. He
had argued rather that, being only a lovelier product of
the common mould, she would abound in the adaptabilities
and pliancies which the lords of the earth have
seen fit to cultivate in their companions. She would
care for his aims because they were his. During their
precipitate wooing, and through the first brief months
of marriage, this profound and original theory had been
gratifyingly confirmed; then its perfect surface had
begun to show a flaw. Amherst had always conveniently
supposed that the poet's line summed up the good
woman's rule of ethics: <i>He for God only, she for God
in him.</i> It was for the god in him, surely, that she had
loved him: for that first glimpse of an "ampler ether,
a diviner air" that he had brought into her cramped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[p 180]</a></span>
and curtained life. He could never, now, evoke that
earlier delusion without feeling on its still-tender surface
the keen edge of Mrs. Ansell's smile. She, no
doubt, could have told him at any time why Bessy had
married him: it was for his <i>beaux yeux</i>, as Mrs. Ansell
would have put it&mdash;because he was young, handsome,
persecuted, an ardent lover if not a subtle one&mdash;because
Bessy had met him at the fatal moment, because her
family had opposed the marriage&mdash;because, in brief, the
gods, that day, may have been a little short of amusement.
Well, they were having their laugh out now&mdash;there
were moments when high heaven seemed to ring
with it....</p>

<p>With these thoughts at his heels Amherst strode on,
overtaken now and again by the wheels of departing
guests from the garden-party, and knowing, as they
passed him, what was in their minds&mdash;envy of his success,
admiration of his cleverness in achieving it, and a
little half-contemptuous pity for his wife, who, with her
wealth and looks, might have done so much better.
Certainly, if the case could have been put to Hanaford&mdash;the
Hanaford of the Gaines garden-party&mdash;it would
have sided with Bessy to a voice. And how much justice
was there in what he felt would have been the unanimous
verdict of her class? Was his mother right in
hinting that he was sacrificing Bessy to the mills? But
the mills <i>were</i> Bessy&mdash;at least he had thought so when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[p 181]</a></span>
he married her! They were her particular form of
contact with life, the expression of her relation to her
fellow-men, her pretext, her opportunity&mdash;unless they
were merely a vast purse in which to plunge for her pin-money!
He had fancied it would rest with him to determine
from which of these stand-points she should
view Westmore; and at the outset she had enthusiastically
viewed it from his. In her eager adoption of his
ideas she had made a pet of the mills, organizing the
Mothers' Club, laying out a recreation-ground on the
Hopewood property, and playing with pretty plans in
water-colour for the Emergency Hospital and the building
which was to contain the night-schools, library and
gymnasium; but even these minor projects&mdash;which he
had urged her to take up as a means of learning their
essential dependence on his larger scheme&mdash;were soon
to be set aside by obstacles of a material order. Bessy
always wanted money&mdash;not a great deal, but, as she
reasonably put it, "enough"&mdash;and who was to blame if
her father and Mr. Tredegar, each in his different capacity,
felt obliged to point out that every philanthropic
outlay at Westmore must entail a corresponding reduction
in her income? Perhaps if she could have been
oftener at Hanaford these arguments would have been
counteracted, for she was tender-hearted, and prompt
to relieve such suffering as she saw about her; but her
imagination was not active, and it was easy for her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[p 182]</a></span>
forget painful sights when they were not under her eye.
This was perhaps&mdash;half-consciously&mdash;one of the reasons
why she avoided Hanaford; why, as Amherst exclaimed,
they had been everywhere since their marriage but to
the place where their obligations called them. There
had, at any rate, always been some good excuse for not
returning there, and consequently for postponing the
work of improvement which, it was generally felt, her
husband could not fitly begin till she <i>had</i> returned and
gone over the ground with him. After their marriage,
and especially in view of the comment excited by that
romantic incident, it was impossible not to yield to her
wish that they should go abroad for a few months;
then, before her confinement, the doctors had exacted
that she should be spared all fatigue and worry; and
after the baby's death Amherst had felt with her too
tenderly to venture an immediate return to unwelcome
questions.</p>

<p>For by this time it had become clear to him that such
questions were, and always would be, unwelcome to
her. As the easiest means of escaping them, she had
once more dismissed the whole problem to the vague
and tiresome sphere of "business," whence he had succeeded
in detaching it for a moment in the early days of
their union. Her first husband&mdash;poor unappreciated
Westmore!&mdash;had always spared her the boredom of
"business," and Halford Gaines and Mr. Tredegar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[p 183]</a></span>
were ready to show her the same consideration; it was
part of the modern code of chivalry that lovely woman
should not be bothered about ways and means. But
Bessy was too much the wife&mdash;and the wife in love&mdash;to
consent that her husband's views on the management
of the mills should be totally disregarded. Precisely
because her advisers looked unfavourably on his intervention,
she felt bound&mdash;if only in defense of her
illusions&mdash;to maintain and emphasize it. The mills
were, in fact, the official "platform" on which she had
married: Amherst's devoted <i>r&ocirc;le</i> at Westmore had justified
the unconventionality of the step. And so she
was committed&mdash;the more helplessly for her dense misintelligence
of both sides of the question&mdash;to the policy
of conciliating the opposing influences which had so
uncomfortably chosen to fight out their case on the
field of her poor little existence: theoretically siding
with her husband, but surreptitiously, as he well knew,
giving aid and comfort to the enemy, who were really
defending her own cause.</p>

<p>All this Amherst saw with that cruel insight which
had replaced his former blindness. He was, in truth,
more ashamed of the insight than of the blindness: it
seemed to him horribly cold-blooded to be thus analyzing,
after two years of marriage, the source of his wife's
inconsistencies. And, partly for this reason, he had
put off from month to month the final question of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[p 184]</a></span>
future management of the mills, and of the radical
changes to be made there if his system were to prevail.
But the time had come when, if Bessy had to turn to
Westmore for the justification of her marriage, he had
even more need of calling upon it for the same service.
He had not, assuredly, married her because of Westmore;
but he would scarcely have contemplated marriage
with a rich woman unless the source of her wealth
had offered him some such opportunity as Westmore
presented. His special training, and the natural bent
of his mind, qualified him, in what had once seemed a
predestined manner, to help Bessy to use her power
nobly, for her own uplifting as well as for that of Westmore;
and so the mills became, incongruously enough,
the plank of safety to which both clung in their sense
of impending disaster.</p>

<p>It was not that Amherst feared the temptation to
idleness if this outlet for his activity were cut off. He
had long since found that the luxury with which his
wife surrounded him merely quickened his natural bent
for hard work and hard fare. He recalled with a touch
of bitterness how he had once regretted having separated
himself from his mother's class, and how seductive
for a moment, to both mind and senses, that other life
had appeared. Well&mdash;he knew it now, and it had
neither charm nor peril for him. Capua must have been
a dull place to one who had once drunk the joy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[p 185]</a></span>
battle. What he dreaded was not that he should learn
to love the life of ease, but that he should grow to loathe
it uncontrollably, as the symbol of his mental and
spiritual bondage. And Westmore was his safety-valve,
his refuge&mdash;if he were cut off from Westmore what remained
to him? It was not only the work he had
found to his hand, but the one work for which his hand
was fitted. It was his life that he was fighting for in
insisting that now at last, before the close of this long-deferred
visit to Hanaford, the question of the mills
should be faced and settled. He had made that clear
to Bessy, in a scene he still shrank from recalling; for it
was of the essence of his somewhat unbending integrity
that he would not trick her into a confused surrender to
the personal influence he still possessed over her, but
must seek to convince her by the tedious process of
argument and exposition, against which she knew no
defense but tears and petulance. But he had, at any
rate, gained her consent to his setting forth his views at
the meeting of directors the next morning; and meanwhile
he had meant to be extraordinarily patient and
reasonable with her, till the hint of Mrs. Ansell's stratagem
produced in him a fresh reaction of distrust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[p 186]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> evening when dinner ended, Mrs. Ansell, with
a glance through the tall dining-room windows,
had suggested to Bessy that it would be pleasanter to
take coffee on the verandah; but Amherst detained his
wife with a glance.</p>

<p>"I should like Bessy to stay," he said.</p>

<p>The dining-room being on the cool side the house,
with a refreshing outlook on the garden, the men preferred
to smoke there rather than in the stuffily-draped
Oriental apartment destined to such rites; and Bessy
Amherst, with a faint sigh, sank back into her seat,
while Mrs. Ansell drifted out through one of the open
windows.</p>

<p>The men surrounding Richard Westmore's table
were the same who nearly three years earlier had
gathered in his house for the same purpose: the discussion
of conditions at the mills. The only perceptible
change in the relation to each other of the persons composing
this group was that John Amherst was now the
host of the other two, instead of being a subordinate
called in for cross-examination; but he was so indifferent,
or at least so heedless, a host&mdash;so forgetful, for
instance, of Mr. Tredegar's preference for a "light"
cigar, and of Mr. Langhope's feelings on the duty of
making the Westmore madeira circulate with the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[p 187]</a></span>&mdash;that
the change was manifest only in his evening-dress,
and in the fact of his sitting at the foot of the table.</p>

<p>If Amherst was conscious of the contrast thus implied,
it was only as a restriction on his freedom. As
far as the welfare of Westmore was concerned he would
rather have stood before his companions as the assistant
manager of the mills than as the husband of their
owner; and it seemed to him, as he looked back, that
he had done very little with the opportunity which
looked so great in the light of his present restrictions.
What he <i>had</i> done with it&mdash;the use to which, as unfriendly
critics might insinuate, he had so adroitly put
it&mdash;had landed him, ironically enough, in the ugly <i>impasse</i>
of a situation from which no issue seemed possible
without some wasteful sacrifice of feeling.</p>

<p>His wife's feelings, for example, were already revealing
themselves in an impatient play of her fan that
made her father presently lean forward to suggest:
"If we men are to talk shop, is it necessary to keep
Bessy in this hot room?"</p>

<p>Amherst rose and opened the window behind his wife's
chair.</p>

<p>"There's a breeze from the west&mdash;the room will be
cooler now," he said, returning to his seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind&mdash;" Bessy murmured, in a tone intended
to give her companions the full measure of what
she was being called on to endure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[p 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar coughed slightly. "May I trouble you
for that other box of cigars, Amherst? No, <i>not</i> the
Caba&ntilde;as." Bessy rose and handed him the box on
which his glance significantly rested. "Ah, thank you,
my dear. I was about to ask," he continued, looking
about for the cigar-lighter, which flamed unheeded at
Amherst's elbow, "what special purpose will be served
by a preliminary review of the questions to be discussed
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;exactly," murmured Mr. Langhope. "The
madeira, my dear John? No&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>please</i>&mdash;to the left!"</p>

<p>Amherst impatiently reversed the direction in which
he had set the precious vessel moving, and turned to
Mr. Tredegar, who was conspicuously lighting his cigar
with a match extracted from his waist-coat pocket.</p>

<p>"The purpose is to define my position in the matter;
and I prefer that Bessy should do this with your help
rather than with mine."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar surveyed his cigar through drooping
lids, as though the question propounded by Amherst
were perched on its tip.</p>

<p>"Is not your position naturally involved in and defined
by hers? You will excuse my saying that&mdash;technically
speaking, of course&mdash;I cannot distinctly conceive
of it as having any separate existence."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar spoke with the deliberate mildness
that was regarded as his most effective weapon at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[p 189]</a></span>
bar, since it was likely to abash those who were too
intelligent to be propitiated by it.</p>

<p>"Certainly it is involved in hers," Amherst agreed;
"but how far that defines it is just what I have waited
till now to find out."</p>

<p>Bessy at this point recalled her presence by a restless
turn of her graceful person, and her father, with an
affectionate glance at her, interposed amicably: "But
surely&mdash;according to old-fashioned ideas&mdash;it implies
identity of interests?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but whose interests?" Amherst asked.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;your wife's, man! She owns the mills."</p>

<p>Amherst hesitated. "I would rather talk of my
wife's interest in the mills than of her interests there;
but we'll keep to the plural if you prefer it. Personally,
I believe the terms should be interchangeable in the
conduct of such a business."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I'm glad to hear that," said Mr. Tredegar
quickly, "since it's precisely the view we all take."</p>

<p>Amherst's colour rose. "Definitions are ambiguous,"
he said. "Before you adopt mine, perhaps I had better
develop it a little farther. What I mean is, that Bessy's
interests in Westmore should be regulated by her interest
in it&mdash;in its welfare as a social body, aside from
its success as a commercial enterprise. If we agree on
this definition, we are at one as to the other: namely
that my relation to the matter is defined by hers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[p 190]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused a moment, as if to give his wife time to
contribute some sign of assent and encouragement; but
she maintained a puzzled silence and he went on:
"There is nothing new in this. I have tried to make
Bessy understand from the beginning what obligations
I thought the ownership of Westmore entailed, and
how I hoped to help her fulfill them; but ever since
our marriage all definite discussion of the subject has
been put off for one cause or another, and that is my
reason for urging that it should be brought up at the
directors' meeting tomorrow."</p>

<p>There was another pause, during which Bessy glanced
tentatively at Mr. Tredegar, and then said, with a
lovely rise of colour: "But, John, I sometimes think
you forget how much has been done at Westmore&mdash;the
Mothers' Club, and the play-ground, and all&mdash;in the
way of carrying out your ideas."</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar discreetly dropped his glance to his
cigar, and Mr. Langhope sounded an irrepressible note
of approval and encouragement.</p>

<p>Amherst smiled. "No, I have not forgotten; and I
am grateful to you for giving my ideas a trial. But
what has been done hitherto is purely superficial."
Bessy's eyes clouded, and he added hastily: "Don't
think I undervalue it for that reason&mdash;heaven knows
the surface of life needs improving! But it's like picking
flowers and sticking them in the ground to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[p 191]</a></span>
garden&mdash;unless you transplant the flower with its roots,
and prepare the soil to receive it, your garden will be
faded tomorrow. No radical changes have yet been
made at Westmore; and it is of radical changes that I
want to speak."</p>

<p>Bessy's look grew more pained, and Mr. Langhope
exclaimed with unwonted irascibility: "Upon my soul,
Amherst, the tone you take about what your wife has
done doesn't strike me as the likeliest way of encouraging
her to do more!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to encourage her to do more on such a
basis&mdash;the sooner she sees the futility of it the better for
Westmore!"</p>

<p>"The futility&mdash;?" Bessy broke out, with a flutter of
tears in her voice; but before her father could intervene
Mr. Tredegar had raised his hand with the gesture
of one accustomed to wield the gavel.</p>

<p>"My dear child, I see Amherst's point, and it is best,
as he says, that you should see it too. What he desires,
as I understand it, is the complete reconstruction of the
present state of things at Westmore; and he is right in
saying that all your good works there&mdash;night-schools,
and nursery, and so forth&mdash;leave that issue untouched."</p>

<p>A smile quivered under Mr. Langhope's moustache.
He and Amherst both knew that Mr. Tredegar's feint
of recognizing the justice of his adversary's claim was
merely the first step to annihilating it; but Bessy could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[p 192]</a></span>
never be made to understand this, and always felt herself
deserted and betrayed when any side but her own
was given a hearing.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if all I have tried to do at Westmore is
useless&mdash;but I suppose I shall never understand business,"
she murmured, vainly seeking consolation in her
father's eye.</p>

<p>"This is not business," Amherst broke in. "It's
the question of your personal relation to the people
there&mdash;the last thing that business considers."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope uttered an impatient exclamation.
"I wish to heaven the owner of the mills had made it
clear just what that relation was to be!"</p>

<p>"I think he did, sir," Amherst answered steadily,
"in leaving his wife the unrestricted control of the
property."</p>

<p>He had reddened under Mr. Langhope's thrust, but
his voice betrayed no irritation, and Bessy rewarded
him with an unexpected beam of sympathy: she was
always up in arms at the least sign of his being treated
as an intruder.</p>

<p>"I am sure, papa," she said, a little tremulously, "that
poor Richard, though he knew I was not clever, felt he
could trust me to take the best advice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's all we ask of you, my child!" her father
sighed, while Mr. Tredegar drily interposed: "We are
merely losing time by this digression. Let me suggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[p 193]</a></span>
that Amherst should give us an idea of the changes he
wishes to make at Westmore."</p>

<p>Amherst, as he turned to answer, remembered with
what ardent faith in his powers of persuasion he had
responded to the same appeal three years earlier. He
had thought then that all his cause needed was a hearing;
now he knew that the practical man's readiness to
let the idealist talk corresponds with the busy parent's
permission to destructive infancy to "run out and play."
They would let him state his case to the four corners of
the earth&mdash;if only he did not expect them to act on it!
It was their policy to let him exhaust himself in argument
and exhortation, to listen to him so politely and
patiently that if he failed to enforce his ideas it should
not be for lack of opportunity to expound them....
And the alternative struck him as hardly less to be
feared. Supposing that the incredible happened, that
his reasons prevailed with his wife, and, through her,
with the others&mdash;at what cost would the victory be won?
Would Bessy ever forgive him for winning it? And
what would his situation be, if it left him in control of
Westmore but estranged from his wife?</p>

<p>He recalled suddenly a phrase he had used that afternoon
to the dark-eyed girl at the garden-party: "What
risks we run when we scramble into the chariot of the
gods!" And at the same instant he heard her retort,
and saw her fine gesture of defiance. How could he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[p 194]</a></span>
ever have doubted that the thing was worth doing at
whatever cost? Something in him&mdash;some secret lurking
element of weakness and evasion&mdash;shrank out of
sight in the light of her question: "Do <i>you</i> act on
that?" and the "God forbid!" he had instantly flashed
back to her. He turned to Mr. Tredegar with his
answer.</p>

<p>Amherst knew that any large theoretical exposition
of the case would be as much wasted on the two men
as on his wife. To gain his point he must take only
one step at a time, and it seemed to him that the first
thing needed at Westmore was that the hands should
work and live under healthier conditions. To attain
this, two important changes were necessary: the floor-space
of the mills must be enlarged, and the company
must cease to rent out tenements, and give the operatives
the opportunity to buy land for themselves. Both
these changes involved the upheaval of the existing
order. Whenever the Westmore mills had been enlarged,
it had been for the sole purpose of increasing
the revenues of the company; and now Amherst asked
that these revenues should be materially and permanently
reduced. As to the suppression of the company
tenement, such a measure struck at the roots of the
baneful paternalism which was choking out every germ
of initiative in the workman. Once the operatives had
room to work in, and the hope of homes of their own to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[p 195]</a></span>
go to when work was over, Amherst was willing to
trust to time for the satisfaction of their other needs.
He believed that a sounder understanding of these needs
would develop on both sides the moment the employers
proved their good faith by the deliberate and permanent
sacrifice of excessive gain to the well-being of the employed;
and once the two had learned to regard each
other not as antagonists but as collaborators, a long
step would have been taken toward a readjustment of
the whole industrial relation. In regard to general and
distant results, Amherst tried not to be too sanguine,
even in his own thoughts. His aim was to remedy
the abuse nearest at hand, in the hope of thus getting
gradually closer to the central evil; and, had his action
been unhampered, he would still have preferred the
longer and more circuitous path of practical experiment
to the sweeping adoption of a new industrial system.</p>

<p>But his demands, moderate as they were, assumed in
his hearers the consciousness of a moral claim superior
to the obligation of making one's business "pay"; and
it was the futility of this assumption that chilled the
arguments on his lips, since in the orthodox creed of the
business world it was a weakness and not a strength to
be content with five per cent where ten was obtainable.
Business was one thing, philanthropy another; and the
enthusiasts who tried combining them were usually reduced,
after a brief flight, to paying fifty cents on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[p 196]</a></span>
dollar, and handing over their stock to a promoter presumably
unhampered by humanitarian ideals.</p>

<p>Amherst knew that this was the answer with which
his plea would be met; knew, moreover, that the plea
was given a hearing simply because his judges deemed
it so pitiably easy to refute. But the knowledge, once
he had begun to speak, fanned his argument to a white
heat of pleading, since, with failure so plainly ahead,
small concessions and compromises were not worth making.
Reason would be wasted on all; but eloquence
might at least prevail with Bessy....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When, late that night, he went upstairs after long
pacings of the garden, he was surprised to see a light
in her room. She was not given to midnight study,
and fearing that she might be ill he knocked at her
door. There was no answer, and after a short pause
he turned the handle and entered.</p>

<p>In the great canopied Westmore couch, her arms
flung upward and her hands clasped beneath her head,
she lay staring fretfully at the globe of electric light
which hung from the centre of the embossed and gilded
ceiling. Seen thus, with the soft curves of throat and
arms revealed, and her face childishly set in a cloud of
loosened hair, she looked no older than Cicely&mdash;and,
like Cicely, inaccessible to grown-up arguments and the
stronger logic of experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[p 197]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a trick of hers, in such moods, to ignore any
attempt to attract her notice; and Amherst was prepared
for her remaining motionless as he paused on the
threshold and then advanced toward the middle of the
room. There had been a time when he would have
been exasperated by her pretense of not seeing him,
but a deep weariness of spirit now dulled him to these
surface pricks.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you were not well when I saw the light
burning," he began.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;I am quite well," she answered in a
colourless voice, without turning her head.</p>

<p>"Shall I put it out, then? You can't sleep with such
a glare in your eyes."</p>

<p>"I should not sleep at any rate; and I hate to lie
awake in the dark."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you sleep?" He moved nearer,
looking down compassionately on her perturbed face
and struggling lips.</p>

<p>She lay silent a moment; then she faltered out:
"B&mdash;because I'm so unhappy!"</p>

<p>The pretense of indifference was swept away by a
gush of childish sobs as she flung over on her side and
buried her face in the embroidered pillows.</p>

<p>Amherst, bending down, laid a quieting hand on her
shoulder. "Bessy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sobbed on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[p 198]</a></span></p>

<p>He seated himself silently in the arm-chair beside the
bed, and kept his soothing hold on her shoulder.
The time had come when he went through all these
accustomed acts of pacification as mechanically as a
nurse soothing a fretful child. And once he had thought
her weeping eloquent! He looked about him at the
spacious room, with its heavy hangings of damask and
the thick velvet carpet which stifled his steps. Everywhere
were the graceful tokens of her presence&mdash;the
vast lace-draped toilet-table strewn with silver and
crystal, the embroidered muslin cushions heaped on
the lounge, the little rose-lined slippers she had just
put off, the lace wrapper, with a scent of violets in
its folds, which he had pushed aside when he sat
down beside her; and he remembered how full of a
mysterious and intimate charm these things had once
appeared to him. It was characteristic that the remembrance
made him more patient with her now.
Perhaps, after all, it was his failure that she was crying
over....</p>

<p>"Don't be unhappy. You decided as seemed best
to you," he said.</p>

<p>She pressed her handkerchief against her lips, still
keeping her head averted. "But I hate all these arguments
and disputes. Why should you unsettle everything?"
she murmured.</p>

<p>His mother's words! Involuntarily he removed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[p 199]</a></span>
hand from her shoulder, though he still remained seated
by the bed.</p>

<p>"You are right. I see the uselessness of it," he assented,
with an uncontrollable note of irony.</p>

<p>She turned her head at the tone, and fixed her plaintive
brimming eyes on him. "You <i>are</i> angry with
me!"</p>

<p>"Was that troubling you?" He leaned forward
again, with compassion in his face. <i>Sancta simplicitas!</i>
was the thought within him.</p>

<p>"I am not angry," he went on; "be reasonable and
try to sleep."</p>

<p>She started upright, the light masses of her hair
floating about her like silken sea-weed lifted on an invisible
tide. "Don't talk like that! I can't endure to
be humoured like a baby. I am unhappy because I
can't see why all these wretched questions should be
dragged into our life. I hate to have you always disagreeing
with Mr. Tredegar, who is so clever and has
so much experience; and yet I hate to see you give way
to him, because that makes it appear as if...as
if...."</p>

<p>"He didn't care a straw for my ideas?" Amherst
smiled. "Well, he doesn't&mdash;and I never dreamed of
making him. So don't worry about that either."</p>

<p>"You never dreamed of making him care for your
ideas? But then why do you&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[p 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do I go on setting them forth at such great
length?" Amherst smiled again. "To convince you&mdash;that's
my only ambition."</p>

<p>She stared at him, shaking her head back to toss a
loose lock from her puzzled eyes. A tear still shone on
her lashes, but with the motion it fell and trembled
down her cheek.</p>

<p>"To convince <i>me</i>? But you know I am so ignorant
of such things."</p>

<p>"Most women are."</p>

<p>"I never pretended to understand anything about&mdash;economics,
or whatever you call it."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her gently. "I thought you
might have begun to understand something about <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"About you?" The colour flowered softly under
her clear skin.</p>

<p>"About what my ideas on such subjects were likely
to be worth&mdash;judging from what you know of me in
other respects." He paused and glanced away from
her. "Well," he concluded deliberately, "I suppose
I've had my answer tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh, John&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He rose and wandered across the room, pausing a
moment to finger absently the trinkets on the dressing-table.
The act recalled with a curious vividness cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[p 201]</a></span>tain
dulled sensations of their first days together, when
to handle and examine these frail little accessories of
her toilet had been part of the wonder and amusement
of his new existence. He could still hear her
laugh as she leaned over him, watching his mystified
look in the glass, till their reflected eyes met there and
drew down her lips to his. He laid down the fragrant
powder-puff he had been turning slowly between his
fingers, and moved back toward the bed. In the interval
he had reached a decision.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;isn't it natural that I should think so?" he
began again, as he stood beside her. "When we married
I never expected you to care or know much about
economics. It isn't a quality a man usually chooses his
wife for. But I had a fancy&mdash;perhaps it shows my
conceit&mdash;that when we had lived together a year or
two, and you'd found out what kind of a fellow I was
in other ways&mdash;ways any woman can judge of&mdash;I had a
fancy that you might take my opinions on faith when it
came to my own special business&mdash;the thing I'm generally
supposed to know about."</p>

<p>He knew that he was touching a sensitive chord, for
Bessy had to the full her sex's pride of possessorship.
He was human and faulty till others criticized him&mdash;then
he became a god. But in this case a conflicting
influence restrained her from complete response to his
appeal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[p 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> feel sure you know&mdash;about the treatment of the
hands and all that; but you said yourself once&mdash;the
first time we ever talked about Westmore&mdash;that the
business part was different&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here it was again, the ancient ineradicable belief in
the separable body and soul! Even an industrial organization
was supposed to be subject to the old theological
distinction, and Bessy was ready to co-operate
with her husband in the emancipation of Westmore's
spiritual part if only its body remained under the law.</p>

<p>Amherst controlled his impatience, as it was always
easy for him to do when he had fixed on a definite line
of conduct.</p>

<p>"It was my situation that was different; not what
you call the business part. That is inextricably bound
up with the treatment of the hands. If I am to have
anything to do with the mills now I can deal with them
only as your representative; and as such I am bound
to take in the whole question."</p>

<p>Bessy's face clouded: was he going into it all again?
But he read her look and went on reassuringly: "That
was what I meant by saying that I hoped you would
take me on faith. If I want the welfare of Westmore
it's above all, I believe, because I want Westmore to
see you as <i>I</i> do&mdash;as the dispenser of happiness, who
could not endure to benefit by any wrong or injustice
to others."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[p 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, of course I don't want to do them
injustice!"</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had seated himself beside her again, clasping in
his the hand with which she was fretting the lace-edged
sheet. He felt her restless fingers surrender slowly, and
her eyes turned to him in appeal.</p>

<p>"But I care for what people say of you too! And
you know&mdash;it's horrid, but one must consider it&mdash;if they
say you're spending my money imprudently...." The
blood rose to her neck and face. "I don't mind for
myself...even if I have to give up as many things as
papa and Mr. Tredegar think...but there is Cicely...and
if people said...."</p>

<p>"If people said I was spending Cicely's money on
improving the condition of the people to whose work
she will some day owe all her wealth&mdash;" Amherst
paused: "Well, I would rather hear that said of me
than any other thing I can think of, except one."</p>

<p>"Except what?"</p>

<p>"That I was doing it with her mother's help and
approval."</p>

<p>She drew a long tremulous sigh: he knew it was
always a relief to her to have him assert himself
strongly. But a residue of resistance still clouded her
mind.</p>

<p>"I should always want to help you, of course; but if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[p 204]</a></span>
Mr. Tredegar and Halford Gaines think your plan unbusinesslike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tredegar and Halford Gaines are certain to
think it so. And that is why I said, just now, that it
comes, in the end, to your choosing between us; taking
them on experience or taking me on faith."</p>

<p>She looked at him wistfully. "Of course I should
expect to give up things.... You wouldn't want me
to live here?"</p>

<p>"I should not ask you to," he said, half-smiling.</p>

<p>"I suppose there would be a good many things we
couldn't do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would certainly have less money for a number
of years; after that, I believe you would have more
rather than less; but I should not want you to think
that, beyond a reasonable point, the prosperity of the
mills was ever to be measured by your dividends."</p>

<p>"No." She leaned back wearily among the pillows.
"I suppose, for instance, we should have to give up
Europe this summer&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Here at last was the bottom of her thought! It was
always on the immediate pleasure that her soul hung:
she had not enough imagination to look beyond, even
in the projecting of her own desires. And it was on
his knowledge of this limitation that Amherst had deliberately
built.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you could go to Europe," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[p 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"The doctor thinks I need it," she faltered.</p>

<p>"In that case, of course&mdash;" He stood up, not abruptly,
or with any show of irritation, but as if accepting
this as her final answer. "What you need most, in the
meantime, is a little sleep," he said. "I will tell your
maid not to disturb you in the morning." He had returned
to his soothing way of speech, as though definitely
resigned to the inutility of farther argument.
"And I will say goodbye now," he continued, "because
I shall probably take an early train, before you
wake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sat up with a start. "An early train? Why,
where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I must go to Chicago some time this month, and as
I shall not be wanted here tomorrow I might as well
run out there at once, and join you next week at
Lynbrook."</p>

<p>Bessy had grown pale. "But I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their eyes met. "Can't you understand that I am
human enough to prefer, under the circumstances, not
being present at tomorrow's meeting?" he said with a
dry laugh.</p>

<p>She sank back with a moan of discouragement,
turning her face away as he began to move toward
his room.</p>

<p>"Shall I put the light out?" he asked, pausing with
his hand on the electric button.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[p 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, please."</p>

<p>He pushed in the button and walked on, guided
through the obscurity by the line of light under his
door. As he reached the threshold he heard a little
choking cry.</p>

<p>"John&mdash;oh, John!"</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I can't <i>bear</i> it!" The sobs increased.</p>

<p>"Bear what?"</p>

<p>"That you should hate me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," he said, groping for his door-handle.</p>

<p>"But you do hate me&mdash;and I deserve it!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dear. Try to sleep."</p>

<p>"I can't sleep till you've forgiven me. Say you
don't hate me! I'll do anything...only say you don't
hate me!"</p>

<p>He stood still a moment, thinking; then he turned
back, and made his way across the room to her side.
As he sat down beside her, he felt her arms reach for
his neck and her wet face press itself against his cheek.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything..." she sobbed; and in the darkness
he held her to him and hated his victory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[p 207]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ansell</span> was engaged in what she called picking
up threads. She had been abroad for the
summer&mdash;had, in, fact, transferred herself but a few
hours earlier from her returning steamer to the little
station at Lynbrook&mdash;and was now, in the bright September
afternoon, which left her in sole possession of
the terrace of Lynbrook House, using that pleasant
eminence as a point of observation from which to
gather up some of the loose ends of history dropped at
her departure.</p>

<p>It might have been thought that the actual scene out-spread
below her&mdash;the descending gardens, the tennis-courts,
the farm-lands sloping away to the blue sea-like
shimmer of the Hempstead plains&mdash;offered, at the
moment, little material for her purpose; but that
was to view them with a superficial eye. Mrs. Ansell's
trained gaze was, for example, greatly enlightened
by the fact that the tennis-courts were fringed by
a group of people indolently watchful of the figures
agitating themselves about the nets; and that, as she
turned her head toward the entrance avenue, the receding
view of a station omnibus, followed by a luggage-cart,
announced that more guests were to be added to
those who had almost taxed to its limits the expansibility
of the luncheon-table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[p 208]</a></span></p>

<p>All this, to the initiated eye, was full of suggestion;
but its significance was as nothing to that presented by
the approach of two figures which, as Mrs. Ansell
watched, detached themselves from the cluster about
the tennis-ground and struck, obliquely and at a desultory
pace, across the lawn toward the terrace. The
figures&mdash;those of a slight young man with stooping
shoulders, and of a lady equally youthful but slenderly
erect&mdash;moved forward in absorbed communion, as if
unconscious of their surroundings and indefinite as to
their direction, till, on the brink of the wide grass terrace
just below their observer's parapet, they paused a
moment and faced each other in closer speech. This
interchange of words, though brief in measure of time,
lasted long enough to add a vivid strand to Mrs. Ansell's
thickening skein; then, on a gesture of the lady's,
and without signs of formal leave-taking, the young
man struck into a path which regained the entrance
avenue, while his companion, quickening her pace,
crossed the grass terrace and mounted the wide stone
steps sweeping up to the house.</p>

<p>These brought her out on the upper terrace a few
yards from Mrs. Ansell's post, and exposed her, unprepared,
to the full beam of welcome which that lady's
rapid advance threw like a searchlight across her path.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Brent! I was just wondering how it was
that I hadn't seen you before." Mrs. Ansell, as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[p 209]</a></span>
spoke, drew the girl's hand into a long soft clasp which
served to keep them confronted while she delicately
groped for whatever thread the encounter seemed to
proffer.</p>

<p>Justine made no attempt to evade the scrutiny to
which she found herself exposed; she merely released
her hand by a movement instinctively evasive of the
mechanical endearment, explaining, with a smile that
softened the gesture: "I was out with Cicely when you
arrived. We've just come in."</p>

<p>"The dear child! I haven't seen her either." Mrs.
Ansell continued to bestow upon the speaker's clear dark
face an intensity of attention in which, for the moment,
Cicely had no perceptible share. "I hear you are
teaching her botany, and all kinds of wonderful things."</p>

<p>Justine smiled again. "I am trying to teach her to
wonder: that is the hardest faculty to cultivate in the
modern child."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I suppose so; in myself," Mrs. Ansell admitted
with a responsive brightness, "I find it develops
with age. The world is a remarkable place." She
threw this off absently, as though leaving Miss Brent to
apply it either to the inorganic phenomena with which
Cicely was supposed to be occupied, or to those subtler
manifestations that engaged her own attention.</p>

<p>"It's a great thing," she continued, "for Bessy to
have had your help&mdash;for Cicely, and for herself too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[p 210]</a></span>
There is so much that I want you to tell me about her.
As an old friend I want the benefit of your fresher eye."</p>

<p>"About Bessy?" Justine hesitated, letting her glance
drift to the distant group still anchored about the tennis-nets.
"Don't you find her looking better?"</p>

<p>"Than when I left? So much so that I was unduly
disturbed, just now, by seeing that clever little doctor&mdash;it
<i>was</i> he, wasn't it, who came up the lawn with you?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Wyant? Yes." Miss Brent hesitated again.
"But he merely called&mdash;with a message."</p>

<p>"Not professionally? <i>Tant mieux!</i> The truth is, I
was anxious about Bessy when I left&mdash;I thought she
ought to have gone abroad for a change. But, as it
turns out, her little excursion with you did as well."</p>

<p>"I think she only needed rest. Perhaps her six
weeks in the Adirondacks were better than Europe."</p>

<p>"Ah, under <i>your</i> care&mdash;that made them better!"
Mrs. Ansell in turn hesitated, the lines of her face
melting and changing as if a rapid stage-hand had
shifted them. When she spoke again they were as
open as a public square, but also as destitute of personal
significance, as flat and smooth as the painted
drop before the real scene it hides.</p>

<p>"I have always thought that Bessy, for all her health
and activity, needs as much care as Cicely&mdash;the kind
of care a clever friend can give. She is so wasteful of
her strength and her nerves, and so unwilling to listen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[p 211]</a></span>
to reason. Poor Dick Westmore watched over her as
if she were a baby; but perhaps Mr. Amherst, who
must have been used to such a different type of woman,
doesn't realize...and then he's so little here...."
The drop was lit up by a smile that seemed to make
it more impenetrable. "As an old friend I can't help
telling you how much I hope she is to have you with
her for a long time&mdash;a long, long time."</p>

<p>Miss Brent bent her head in slight acknowledgment
of the tribute. "Oh, soon she will not need any
care&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Brent, she will always need it!" Mrs.
Ansell made a movement inviting the young girl to share
the bench from which, at the latter's approach, she had
risen. "But perhaps there is not enough in such a
life to satisfy your professional energies."</p>

<p>She seated herself, and after an imperceptible pause
Justine sank into the seat beside her. "I am very glad,
just now, to give my energies a holiday," she said, leaning
back with a little sigh of retrospective weariness.</p>

<p>"You are tired too? Bessy wrote me you had been
quite used up by a trying case after we saw you at
Hanaford."</p>

<p>Miss Brent smiled. "When a nurse is fit for work
she calls a trying case a 'beautiful' one."</p>

<p>"But meanwhile&mdash;?" Mrs. Ansell shone on her
with elder-sisterly solicitude. "Meanwhile, why not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[p 212]</a></span>
stay on with Cicely&mdash;above all, with Bessy? Surely she's
a 'beautiful' case too."</p>

<p>"Isn't she?" Justine laughingly agreed.</p>

<p>"And if you want to be tried&mdash;" Mrs. Ansell swept
the scene with a slight lift of her philosophic shoulders&mdash;"you'll
find there are trials enough everywhere."</p>

<p>Her companion started up with a glance at the small
watch on her breast. "One of them is that it's already
after four, and that I must see that tea is sent down to
the tennis-ground, and the new arrivals looked after."</p>

<p>"I saw the omnibus on its way to the station. Are
many more people coming?"</p>

<p>"Five or six, I believe. The house is usually full for
Sunday."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell made a slight motion to detain her.
"And when is Mr. Amherst expected?"</p>

<p>Miss Brent's pale cheek seemed to take on a darker
tone of ivory, and her glance dropped from her companion's
face to the vivid stretch of gardens at their
feet. "Bessy has not told me," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" the older woman rejoined, looking also
toward the gardens, as if to intercept Miss Brent's
glance in its flight. The latter stood still a moment,
with the appearance of not wishing to evade whatever
else her companion might have to say; then she moved
away, entering the house by one window just as Mr.
Langhope emerged from it by another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[p 213]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of his stick tapping across the bricks roused
Mrs. Ansell from her musings, but she showed her
sense of his presence simply by returning to the bench
she had just left; and accepting this mute invitation,
Mr. Langhope crossed the terrace and seated himself
at her side.</p>

<p>When he had done so they continued to look at each
other without speaking, after the manner of old friends
possessed of occult means of communication; and as
the result of this inward colloquy Mr. Langhope at
length said: "Well, what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i>?" she rejoined, turning full upon him
a face so released from its usual defences and disguises
that it looked at once older and more simple than the
countenance she presented to the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope waved a deprecating hand. "I want
your fresher impressions."</p>

<p>"That's what I just now said to Miss Brent."</p>

<p>"You've been talking to Miss Brent?"</p>

<p>"Only a flying word&mdash;she had to go and look after
the new arrivals."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's attention deepened. "Well, what
did you say to her?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather hear what she said to <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "A good cross-examiner always gets the
answers he wants. Let me hear your side, and I shall
know hers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[p 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say that applied only to stupid cross-examiners;
or to those who have stupid subjects
to deal with. And Miss Brent is not stupid, you
know."</p>

<p>"Far from it! What else do you make out?"</p>

<p>"I make out that she's in possession."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Don't look startled. Do you dislike her?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid&mdash;with those eyes! She has a wit of
her own, too&mdash;and she certainly makes things easier
for Bessy."</p>

<p>"She guards her carefully, at any rate. I could find
out nothing."</p>

<p>"About Bessy?"</p>

<p>"About the general situation."</p>

<p>"Including Miss Brent?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell smiled faintly. "I made one little discovery
about her."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She's intimate with the new doctor."</p>

<p>"Wyant?" Mr. Langhope's interest dropped. "What
of that? I believe she knew him before."</p>

<p>"I daresay. It's of no special importance, except as
giving us a possible clue to her character. She strikes
me as interesting and mysterious."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope smiled. "The things your imagination
does for you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[p 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"It helps me to see that we may find Miss Brent useful
as a friend."</p>

<p>"A friend?"</p>

<p>"An ally." She paused, as if searching for a word.
"She may restore the equilibrium."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's handsome face darkened. "Open
Bessy's eyes to Amherst? Damn him!" he said quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell let the imprecation pass. "When was he
last here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Five or six weeks ago&mdash;for one night. His only
visit since she came back from the Adirondacks."</p>

<p>"What do you think his motive is? He must know
what he risks in losing his hold on Bessy."</p>

<p>"His motive? With your eye for them, can you ask?
A devouring ambition, that's all! Haven't you noticed
that, in all except the biggest minds, ambition takes the
form of wanting to command where one has had to
obey? Amherst has been made to toe the line at Westmore,
and now he wants Truscomb&mdash;yes, and Halford
Gaines, too!&mdash;to do the same. That's the secret of his
servant-of-the-people pose&mdash;gad, I believe it's the whole
secret of his marriage! He's devouring my daughter's
substance to pay off an old score against the mills.
He'll never rest till he has Truscomb out, and some
creature of his own in command&mdash;and then, <i>vogue la
gal&egrave;re</i>! If it were women, now," Mr. Langhope
summed up impatiently, "one could understand it, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[p 216]</a></span>
his age, and with that damned romantic head&mdash;but to be
put aside for a lot of low mongrelly socialist mill-hands&mdash;ah,
my poor girl&mdash;my poor girl!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell mused. "You didn't write me that
things were so bad. There's been no actual quarrel?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"How can there be, when the poor child does all he
wants? He's simply too busy to come and thank her!"</p>

<p>"Too busy at Hanaford?"</p>

<p>"So he says. Introducing the golden age at Westmore&mdash;it's
likely to be the age of copper at Lynbrook."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell drew a meditative breath. "I was
thinking of that. I understood that Bessy would have
to retrench while the changes at Westmore were going
on."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;didn't she give up Europe, and cable over to
countermand her new motor?"</p>

<p>"But the life here! This mob of people! Miss
Brent tells me the house is full for every week-end."</p>

<p>"Would you have my daughter cut off from all her
friends?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell met this promptly. "From some of the
new ones, at any rate! Have you heard who has just
arrived?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's hesitation showed a tinge of embarrassment.
"I'm not sure&mdash;some one has always
just arrived."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[p 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, the Fenton Carburys, then!" Mrs. Ansell
left it to her tone to annotate the announcement.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope raised his eyebrows slightly. "Are
they likely to be an exceptionally costly pleasure?"</p>

<p>"If you're trying to prove that I haven't kept to the
point&mdash;I can assure you that I'm well within it!"</p>

<p>"But since the good Blanche has got her divorce and
married Carbury, wherein do they differ from other
week-end automata?"</p>

<p>"Because most divorced women marry again to be
respectable."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope smiled faintly. "Yes&mdash;that's their
punishment. But it would be too dull for Blanche."</p>

<p>"Precisely. <i>She</i> married again to see Ned Bowfort!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;that may yet be hers!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell sighed at his perversity. "Meanwhile,
she's brought him here, and it is unnatural to see Bessy
lending herself to such combinations."</p>

<p>"You're corrupted by a glimpse of the old societies.
Here Bowfort and Carbury are simply hands at bridge."</p>

<p>"Old hands at it&mdash;yes! And the bridge is another
point: Bessy never used to play for money."</p>

<p>"Well, she may make something, and offset her husband's
prodigalities."</p>

<p>"There again&mdash;with this <i>train de vie</i>, how on earth
are both ends to meet?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[p 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Langhope grown suddenly grave, struck his cane
resoundingly on the terrace. "Westmore and Lynbrook?
I don't want them to&mdash;I want them to get
farther and farther apart!"</p>

<p>She cast on him a look of startled divination. "You
want Bessy to go on spending too much money?"</p>

<p>"How can I help it if it costs?"</p>

<p>"If what costs&mdash;?" She stopped, her eyes still wide;
then their glances crossed, and she exclaimed: "If
your scheme costs? It <i>is</i> your scheme, then?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders again. "It's a passive
attitude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, the deepest plans are that!" Mr. Langhope
uttered no protest, and she continued to piece her conjectures
together. "But you expect it to lead up to
something active. Do you want a rupture?"</p>

<p>"I want him brought back to his senses."</p>

<p>"Do you think that will bring him back to <i>her</i>?"</p>

<p>"Where the devil else will he have to go?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell's eyes dropped toward the gardens, across
which desultory knots of people were straggling back
from the ended tennis-match. "Ah, here they all
come," she said, rising with a half-sigh; and as she
stood watching the advance of the brightly-tinted groups
she added slowly: "It's ingenious&mdash;but you don't understand
him."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope stroked his moustache. "Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[p 219]</a></span>
not," he assented thoughtfully. "But suppose we go
in before they join us? I want to show you a set of
Ming I picked up the other day for Bessy. I flatter
myself I <i>do</i> understand Ming."</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Justine Brent</span>, her household duties discharged,
had gone upstairs to her room, a little turret
chamber projecting above the wide terrace below, from
which the sounds of lively intercourse now rose increasingly
to her window.</p>

<p>Bessy, she knew, would have preferred to have her remain
with the party from whom these evidences of gaiety
proceeded. Mrs. Amherst had grown to depend on her
friend's nearness. She liked to feel that Justine's quick
hand and eye were always in waiting on her impulses,
prompt to interpret and execute them without any
exertion of her own. Bessy combined great zeal in
the pursuit of sport&mdash;a tireless passion for the saddle,
the golf-course, the tennis-court&mdash;with an almost oriental
inertia within doors, an indolence of body and
brain that made her shrink from the active obligations
of hospitality, though she had grown to depend more
and more on the distractions of a crowded house.</p>

<p>But Justine, though grateful, and anxious to show
her gratitude, was unwilling to add to her other duties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[p 220]</a></span>
that of joining in the amusements of the house-party.
She made no pretense of effacing herself when she
thought her presence might be useful&mdash;but, even if she
had cared for the diversions in favour at Lynbrook, a
certain unavowed pride would have kept her from participating
in them on the same footing with Bessy's
guests. She was not in the least ashamed of her
position in the household, but she chose that every one
else should be aware of it, that she should not for an
instant be taken for one of the nomadic damsels who
form the camp-followers of the great army of pleasure.
Yet even on this point her sensitiveness was not exaggerated.
Adversity has a deft hand at gathering loose
strands of impulse into character, and Justine's early
contact with different phases of experience had given
her a fairly clear view of life in the round, what might
be called a sound working topography of its relative
heights and depths. She was not seriously afraid of
being taken for anything but what she really was,
and still less did she fear to become, by force of propinquity
and suggestion, the kind of being for whom
she might be temporarily taken.</p>

<p>When, at Bessy's summons, she had joined the
latter at her camp in the Adirondacks, the transition
from a fatiguing "case" at Hanaford to a life in which
sylvan freedom was artfully blent with the most studied
personal luxury, had come as a delicious refreshment to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[p 221]</a></span>
body and brain. She was weary, for the moment, of
ugliness, pain and hard work, and life seemed to recover
its meaning under the aspect of a graceful leisure.
Lynbrook also, whither she had been persuaded to go
with Bessy at the end of their woodland cure, had at
first amused and interested her. The big house on its
spreading terraces, with windows looking over bright
gardens to the hazy distances of the plains, seemed a
haven of harmless ease and gaiety. Justine was sensitive
to the finer graces of luxurious living, to the warm
lights on old pictures and bronzes, the soft mingling of
tints in faded rugs and panellings of time-warmed oak.
And the existence to which this background formed a
setting seemed at first to have the same decorative
qualities. It was pleasant, for once, to be among people
whose chief business was to look well and take life
lightly, and Justine's own buoyancy of nature won her
immediate access among the amiable persons who
peopled Bessy's week-end parties. If they had only
abounded a little more in their own line she might have
succumbed to their spell. But it seemed to her that
they missed the poetry of their situation, transacting
their pleasures with the dreary method and shortness
of view of a race tethered to the ledger. Even the
verbal flexibility which had made her feel that she was
in a world of freer ideas, soon revealed itself as a form
of flight from them, in which the race was distinctly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[p 222]</a></span>
the swift; and Justine's phase of passive enjoyment
passed with the return of her physical and mental activity.
She was a creature tingling with energy, a little
fleeting particle of the power that moves the sun and
the other stars, and the deadening influences of the life
at Lynbrook roused these tendencies to greater intensity,
as a suffocated person will suddenly develop abnormal
strength in the struggle for air.</p>

<p>She did not, indeed, regret having come. She was
glad to be with Bessy, partly because of the childish
friendship which had left such deep traces in her lonely
heart, and partly because what she had seen of her
friend's situation stirred in her all the impulses of sympathy
and service; but the idea of continuing in such a
life, of sinking into any of the positions of semi-dependence
that an adroit and handsome girl may create for
herself in a fashionable woman's train&mdash;this possibility
never presented itself to Justine till Mrs. Ansell, that
afternoon, had put it into words. And to hear it was
to revolt from it with all the strength of her inmost nature.
The thought of the future troubled her, not so
much materially&mdash;for she had a light bird-like trust in
the morrow's fare&mdash;but because her own tendencies
seemed to have grown less clear, because she could not
rest in them for guidance as she had once done. The
renewal of bodily activity had not brought back her
faith in her calling: her work had lost the light of con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[p 223]</a></span>secration.
She no longer felt herself predestined to
nurse the sick for the rest of her life, and in her inexperience
she reproached herself with this instability.
Youth and womanhood were in fact crying out in her
for their individual satisfaction; but instincts as deep-seated
protected her from even a momentary illusion
as to the nature of this demand. She wanted happiness,
and a life of her own, as passionately as young
flesh-and-blood had ever wanted them; but they must
come bathed in the light of imagination and penetrated
by the sense of larger affinities. She could not conceive
of shutting herself into a little citadel of personal well-being
while the great tides of existence rolled on unheeded
outside. Whether they swept treasure to her
feet, or strewed her life with wreckage, she felt, even
now; that her place was there, on the banks, in sound
and sight of the great current; and just in proportion
as the scheme of life at Lynbrook succeeded in shutting
out all sense of that vaster human consciousness, so did
its voice speak more thrillingly within her.</p>

<p>Somewhere, she felt&mdash;but, alas! still out of reach&mdash;was
the life she longed for, a life in which high chances
of doing should be mated with the finer forms of enjoying.
But what title had she to a share in such an existence?
Why, none but her sense of what it was
worth&mdash;and what did that count for, in a world which
used all its resources to barricade itself against all its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[p 224]</a></span>
opportunities? She knew there were girls who sought,
by what is called a "good" marriage, an escape into
the outer world, of doing and thinking&mdash;utilizing an
empty brain and full pocket as the key to these envied
fields. Some such chance the life at Lynbrook seemed
likely enough to offer&mdash;one is not, at Justine's age and
with her penetration, any more blind to the poise of
one's head than to the turn of one's ideas; but here the
subtler obstacles of taste and pride intervened. Not
even Bessy's transparent man&#339;uvrings, her tender
solicitude for her friend's happiness, could for a moment
weaken Justine's resistance. If she must marry
without love&mdash;and this was growing conceivable to
her&mdash;she must at least merge her craving for personal
happiness in some view of life in harmony with
hers.</p>

<p>A tap on her door interrupted these musings, to one
aspect of which Bessy Amherst's entrance seemed suddenly
to give visible expression.</p>

<p>"Why did you run off, Justine? You promised to be
down-stairs when I came back from tennis."</p>

<p>"<i>Till</i> you came back&mdash;wasn't it, dear?" Justine corrected
with a smile, pushing her arm-chair forward as
Bessy continued to linger irresolutely in the doorway.
"I saw that there was a fresh supply of tea in the
drawing-room, and I knew you would be there before
the omnibus came from the station."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[p 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I was there&mdash;but everybody was asking for
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everybody?" Justine gave a mocking lift to her
dark eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Westy Gaines, at any rate; the moment he
set foot in the house!" Bessy declared with a laugh as
she dropped into the arm-chair.</p>

<p>Justine echoed the laugh, but offered no comment
on the statement which accompanied it, and for a
moment both women were silent, Bessy tilting her
pretty discontented head against the back of the
chair, so that her eyes were on a level with those of
her friend, who leaned near her in the embrasure of
the window.</p>

<p>"I can't understand you, Justine. You know well
enough what he's come back for."</p>

<p>"In order to dazzle Hanaford with the fact that he
has been staying at Lynbrook!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense&mdash;the novelty of that has worn off. He's
been here three times since we came back."</p>

<p>"You are admirably hospitable to your family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bessy let her pretty ringed hands fall with a discouraged
gesture. "Why do you find him so much
worse than&mdash;than other people?"</p>

<p>Justine's eye-brows rose again. "In the same capacity?
You speak as if I had boundless opportunities
of comparison."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[p 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you've Dr. Wyant!" Mrs. Amherst suddenly
flung back at her.</p>

<p>Justine coloured under the unexpected thrust, but
met her friend's eyes steadily. "As an alternative to
Westy? Well, if I were on a desert island&mdash;but I'm
not!" she concluded with a careless laugh.</p>

<p>Bessy frowned and sighed. "You can't mean that,
of the two&mdash;?" She paused and then went on doubtfully:
"It's because he's cleverer?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Wyant?" Justine smiled. "It's not making an
enormous claim for him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know Westy's not brilliant; but stupid men
are not always the hardest to live with." She sighed
again, and turned on Justine a glance charged with conjugal
experience.</p>

<p>Justine had sunk into the window-seat, her thin hands
clasping her knee, in the attitude habitual to her meditative
moments. "Perhaps not," she assented; "but
I don't know that I should care for a man who made
life easy; I should want some one who made it interesting."</p>

<p>Bessy met this with a pitying exclamation. "Don't
imagine you invented that! Every girl thinks it. Afterwards
she finds out that it's much pleasanter to be
thought interesting herself."</p>

<p>She spoke with a bitterness that issued strangely from
her lips. It was this bitterness which gave her soft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[p 227]</a></span>
personality the sharp edge that Justine had felt in it
on the day of their meeting at Hanaford.</p>

<p>The girl, at first, had tried to defend herself from
these scarcely-veiled confidences, distasteful enough in
themselves, and placing her, if she listened, in an attitude
of implied disloyalty to the man under whose roof
they were spoken. But a precocious experience of life
had taught her that emotions too strong for the nature
containing them turn, by some law of spiritual chemistry,
into a rankling poison; and she had therefore resigned
herself to serving as a kind of outlet for Bessy's
pent-up discontent. It was not that her friend's grievance
appealed to her personal sympathies; she had
learned enough of the situation to give her moral assent
unreservedly to the other side. But it was characteristic
of Justine that where she sympathized least she
sometimes pitied most. Like all quick spirits she was
often intolerant of dulness; yet when the intolerance
passed it left a residue of compassion for the very incapacity
at which she chafed. It seemed to her that
the tragic crises in wedded life usually turned on the
stupidity of one of the two concerned; and of the two
victims of such a catastrophe she felt most for the one
whose limitations had probably brought it about. After
all, there could be no imprisonment as cruel as that of
being bounded by a hard small nature. Not to be
penetrable at all points to the shifting lights, the wan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[p 228]</a></span>dering
music of the world&mdash;she could imagine no physical
disability as cramping as that. How the little
parched soul, in solitary confinement for life, must pine
and dwindle in its blind cranny of self-love!</p>

<p>To be one's self wide open to the currents of life
does not always contribute to an understanding of
narrower natures; but in Justine the personal emotions
were enriched and deepened by a sense of participation
in all that the world about her was doing, suffering
and enjoying; and this sense found expression in the
instinct of ministry and solace. She was by nature a
redresser, a restorer; and in her work, as she had once
told Amherst, the longing to help and direct, to hasten
on by personal intervention time's slow and clumsy
processes, had often been in conflict with the restrictions
imposed by her profession. But she had no idle
desire to probe the depths of other lives; and where
there seemed no hope of serving she shrank from fruitless
confidences. She was beginning to feel this to be
the case with Bessy Amherst. To touch the rock was
not enough, if there were but a few drops within it; yet
in this barrenness lay the pathos of the situation&mdash;and
after all, may not the scanty spring be fed from a fuller
current?</p>

<p>"I'm not sure about that," she said, answering her
friend's last words after a deep pause of deliberation.
"I mean about its being so pleasant to be found inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[p 229]</a></span>esting.
I'm sure the passive part is always the dull
one: life has been a great deal more thrilling since we
found out that we revolved about the sun, instead of
sitting still and fancying that all the planets were dancing
attendance on us. After all, they were <i>not</i>; and
it's rather humiliating to think how the morning stars
must have laughed together about it!"</p>

<p>There was no self-complacency in Justine's eagerness
to help. It was far easier for her to express it in
action than in counsel, to grope for the path with her
friend than to point the way to it; and when she had to
speak she took refuge in figures to escape the pedantry
of appearing to advise. But it was not only to Mrs.
Dressel that her parables were dark, and the blank
look in Bessy's eyes soon snatched her down from the
height of metaphor.</p>

<p>"I mean," she continued with a smile, "that, as
human nature is constituted, it has got to find its real
self&mdash;the self to be interested in&mdash;outside of what we
conventionally call 'self': the particular Justine or Bessy
who is clamouring for her particular morsel of life.
You see, self isn't a thing one can keep in a box&mdash;bits
of it keep escaping, and flying off to lodge in all sorts
of unexpected crannies; we come across scraps of ourselves
in the most unlikely places&mdash;as I believe you
would in Westmore, if you'd only go back there and
look for them!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[p 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessy's lip trembled and the colour sprang to her
face; but she answered with a flash of irritation: "Why
doesn't <i>he</i> look for me there, then&mdash;if he still wants to
find me?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;it's for him to look here&mdash;to find himself <i>here</i>,"
Justine murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, he never comes here! That's his answer."</p>

<p>"He will&mdash;he will! Only, when he does, let him
find you."</p>

<p>"Find me? I don't understand. How can he,
when he never sees me? I'm no more to him than the
carpet on the floor!"</p>

<p>Justine smiled again. "Well&mdash;be that then! The
thing is to <i>be</i>."</p>

<p>"Under his feet? Thank you! Is that what you
mean to marry for? It's not what husbands admire
in one, you know!"</p>

<p>"No." Justine stood up with a sense of stealing
discouragement. "But I don't think I want to be
admired&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's because you know you are!" broke from
the depths of the other's bitterness.</p>

<p>The tone smote Justine, and she dropped into the
seat at her friend's side, silently laying a hand on Bessy's
feverishly-clasped fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let us talk about me," complained the
latter, from whose lips the subject was never long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[p 231]</a></span>
absent. "And you mustn't think I <i>want</i> you to
marry, Justine; not for myself, I mean&mdash;I'd so much
rather keep you here. I feel much less lonely when
you're with me. But you say you won't stay&mdash;and it's
too dreadful to think of your going back to that dreary
hospital."</p>

<p>"But you know the hospital's not dreary to me,"
Justine interposed; "it's the most interesting place I've
ever known."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst smiled indulgently on this extravagance.
"A great many people go through the craze
for philanthropy&mdash;" she began in the tone of mature
experience; but Justine interrupted her with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Philanthropy? I'm not philanthropic. I don't
think I ever felt inclined to do good in the abstract&mdash;any
more than to do ill! I can't remember that I ever
planned out a course of conduct in my life. It's only,"
she went on, with a puzzled frown, as if honestly trying
to analyze her motives, "it's only that I'm so fatally
interested in people that before I know it I've slipped
into their skins; and then, of course, if anything goes
wrong with them, it's just as if it had gone wrong with
me; and I can't help trying to rescue myself from <i>their</i>
troubles! I suppose it's what you'd call meddling&mdash;and
so should I, if I could only remember that the other
people were not myself!"</p>

<p>Bessy received this with the mild tolerance of su<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[p 232]</a></span>perior
wisdom. Once safe on the tried ground of traditional
authority, she always felt herself Justine's
superior. "That's all very well now&mdash;you see the
romantic side of it," she said, as if humouring her
friend's vagaries. "But in time you'll want something
else; you'll want a husband and children&mdash;a life of
your own. And then you'll have to be more practical.
It's ridiculous to pretend that comfort and money don't
make a difference. And if you married a rich man,
just think what a lot of good you could do! Westy will
be very well off&mdash;and I'm sure he'd let you endow
hospitals and things. Think how interesting it would
be to build a ward in the very hospital where you'd
been a nurse! I read something like that in a novel
the other day&mdash;it was beautifully described. All the
nurses and doctors that the heroine had worked with
were there to receive her...and her little boy went
about and gave toys to the crippled children...."</p>

<p>If the speaker's concluding instance hardly produced
the effect she had intended, it was perhaps only because
Justine's attention had been arrested by the earlier part
of the argument. It was strange to have marriage
urged on her by a woman who had twice failed to find
happiness in it&mdash;strange, and yet how vivid a sign that,
even to a nature absorbed in its personal demands, not
happiness but completeness is the inmost craving! "A
life of your own"&mdash;that was what even Bessy, in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[p 233]</a></span>
obscure way, felt to be best worth suffering for. And
how was a spirit like Justine's, thrilling with youth and
sympathy, to conceive of an isolated existence as the
final answer to that craving? A life circumscribed by
one's own poor personal consciousness would not be
life at all&mdash;far better the "adventure of the diver" than
the shivering alone on the bank! Bessy, reading encouragement
in her silence, returned her hand-clasp
with an affectionate pressure.</p>

<p>"You <i>would</i> like that, Justine?" she said, secretly
proud of having hit on the convincing argument.</p>

<p>"To endow hospitals with your cousin's money? No;
I should want something much more exciting!"</p>

<p>Bessy's face kindled. "You mean travelling abroad&mdash;and
I suppose New York in winter?"</p>

<p>Justine broke into a laugh. "I was thinking of your
cousin himself when I spoke." And to Bessy's disappointed
cry&mdash;"Then it <i>is</i> Dr. Wyant, after all?" she
answered lightly, and without resenting the challenge:
"I don't know. Suppose we leave it to the oracle."</p>

<p>"The oracle?"</p>

<p>"Time. His question-and-answer department is generally
the most reliable in the long run." She started
up, gently drawing Bessy to her feet. "And just at
present he reminds me that it's nearly six, and that you
promised Cicely to go and see her before you dress for
dinner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[p 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessy rose obediently. "Does he remind you of
<i>your</i> promises too? You said you'd come down to
dinner tonight."</p>

<p>"Did I?" Justine hesitated. "Well, I'm coming,"
she said, smiling and kissing her friend.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the door closed on Mrs. Amherst a resolve
which had taken shape in Justine's mind during
their talk together made her seat herself at her
writing-table, where, after a moment's musing over her
suspended pen, she wrote and addressed a hurried note.
This business despatched, she put on her hat and jacket,
and letter in hand passed down the corridor from her
room, and descended to the entrance-hall below. She
might have consigned her missive to the post-box which
conspicuously tendered its services from a table near
the door; but to do so would delay the letter's despatch
till morning, and she felt a sudden impatience to see
it start.</p>

<p>The tumult on the terrace had transferred itself
within doors, and as Justine went down the stairs she
heard the click of cues from the billiard-room, the talk
and laughter of belated bridge-players, the movement
of servants gathering up tea-cups and mending fires.
She had hoped to find the hall empty, but the sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[p 235]</a></span>
of Westy Gaines's figure looming watchfully on the
threshold of the smoking-room gave her, at the last
bend of the stairs, a little start of annoyance. He
would want to know where she was going, he would
offer to go with her, and it would take some time and
not a little emphasis to make him understand that his
society was not desired.</p>

<p>This was the thought that flashed through Justine's
mind as she reached the landing; but the next moment
it gave way to a contradictory feeling. Westy Gaines
was not alone in the hall. From under the stairway
rose the voices of a group ensconced in that popular
retreat about a chess-board; and as Justine reached
the last turn of the stairs she perceived that Mason
Winch, an earnest youth with advanced views on political
economy, was engaged, to the diversion of a
circle of spectators, in teaching the Telfer girls chess.
The futility of trying to fix the spasmodic attention of
this effervescent couple, and their instructor's grave
unconsciousness of the fact, constituted, for the lookers-on,
the peculiar diversion of the scene. It was of
course inevitable that young Winch, on his arrival at
Lynbrook, should have succumbed at once to the tumultuous
charms of the Telfer manner, which was
equally attractive to inarticulate youth and to tired and
talked-out middle-age; but that he should have perceived
no resistance in their minds to the deliberative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[p 236]</a></span>
processes of the game of chess, was, even to the Telfers
themselves, a source of unmitigated gaiety. Nothing
seemed to them funnier than that any one should credit
them with any mental capacity; and they had inexhaustibly
amusing ways of drawing out and showing off
each other's ignorance.</p>

<p>It was on this scene that Westy's appreciative eyes
had been fixed till Justine's appearance drew them to
herself. He pronounced her name joyfully, and moved
forward to greet her; but as their hands met she understood
that he did not mean to press his company upon
her. Under the eye of the Lynbrook circle he was
chary of marked demonstrations, and even Mrs. Amherst's
approval could not, at such moments, bridge
over the gap between himself and the object of his
attentions. A Gaines was a Gaines in the last analysis,
and apart from any pleasing accident of personality;
but what was Miss Brent but the transient vehicle of
those graces which Providence has provided for the
delectation of the privileged sex?</p>

<p>These influences were visible in the temperate warmth
of Westy's manner, and in his way of keeping a backward
eye on the mute interchange of comment about
the chess-board. At another time his embarrassment
would have amused Justine; but the feelings stirred by
her talk with Bessy had not subsided, and she recognized
with a sting of mortification the resemblance be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[p 237]</a></span>tween
her view of the Lynbrook set and its estimate of
herself. If Bessy's friends were negligible to her she
was almost non-existent to them; and, as against herself,
they were overwhelmingly provided with tangible
means of proving their case.</p>

<p>Such considerations, at a given moment, may prevail
decisively even with a nature armed against them by
insight and irony; and the mere fact that Westy Gaines
did not mean to join her, and that he was withheld
from doing so by the invisible pressure of the Lynbrook
standards, had the effect of precipitating Justine's
floating intentions.</p>

<p>If anything farther had been needed to hasten this
result, it would have been accomplished by the sound
of footsteps which, over-taking her a dozen yards from
the house, announced her admirer's impetuous if tardy
pursuit. The act of dismissing him, though it took but
a word and was effected with a laugh, left her pride
quivering with a hurt the more painful because she
would not acknowledge it. That she should waste a
moment's resentment on the conduct of a person so
unimportant as poor Westy, showed her in a flash the
intrinsic falseness of her position at Lynbrook. She
saw that to disdain the life about her had not kept her
intact from it; and the knowledge made her feel anew
the need of some strong decentralizing influence, some
purifying influx of emotion and activity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[p 238]</a></span></p>

<p>She had walked on quickly through the clear October
twilight, which was still saturated with the after-glow
of a vivid sunset; and a few minutes brought her to the
village stretching along the turnpike beyond the Lynbrook
gates. The new post-office dominated the row
of shabby houses and "stores" set disjointedly under
reddening maples, and its arched doorway formed the
centre of Lynbrook's evening intercourse.</p>

<p>Justine, hastening toward the knot of loungers on
the threshold, had no consciousness of anything outside
of her own thoughts; and as she mounted the steps she
was surprised to see Dr. Wyant detach himself from
the group and advance to meet her.</p>

<p>"May I post your letter?" he asked, lifting his hat.</p>

<p>His gesture uncovered the close-curling hair of a
small delicately-finished head just saved from effeminacy
by the vigorous jut of heavy eye-brows meeting
above full grey eyes. The eyes again, at first sight,
might have struck one as too expressive, or as expressing
things too purely decorative for the purposes of a
young country doctor with a growing practice; but this
estimate was corrected by an unexpected abruptness
in their owner's voice and manner. Perhaps the final
impression produced on a close observer by Dr.
Stephen Wyant would have been that the contradictory
qualities of which he was compounded had not yet been
brought into equilibrium by the hand of time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[p 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine, in reply to his question, had drawn back a
step, slipping her letter into the breast of her jacket.</p>

<p>"That is hardly worth while, since it was addressed
to you," she answered with a slight smile as she turned
to descend the post-office steps.</p>

<p>Wyant, still carrying his hat, and walking with quick
uneven steps, followed her in silence till they had passed
beyond earshot of the loiterers on the threshold; then,
in the shade of the maple boughs, he pulled up and
faced her.</p>

<p>"You've written to say that I may come tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Justine hesitated. "Yes," she said at length.</p>

<p>"Good God! You give royally!" he broke out, pushing
his hand with a nervous gesture through the thin
dark curls on his forehead.</p>

<p>Justine laughed, with a trace of nervousness in her
own tone. "And you talk&mdash;well, imperially! Aren't
you afraid to bankrupt the language?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he said, staring.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> mean? I have merely said that I
would see you tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," he retorted, "that's enough for my happiness!"</p>

<p>She sounded her light laugh again. "I'm glad to
know you're so easily pleased."</p>

<p>"I'm not! But you couldn't have done a cruel thing
without a struggle; and since you're ready to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[p 240]</a></span>
me my answer tomorrow, I know it can't be a cruel
one."</p>

<p>They had begun to walk onward as they talked, but
at this she halted. "Please don't take that tone. I
dislike sentimentality!" she exclaimed, with a tinge of
imperiousness that was a surprise to her own ears.</p>

<p>It was not the first time in the course of her friendship
with Stephen Wyant that she had been startled by
this intervention of something within her that resisted
and almost resented his homage. When they were
apart, she was conscious only of the community of interests
and sympathies that had first drawn them together.
Why was it then&mdash;since his looks were of the
kind generally thought to stand a suitor in good stead&mdash;that
whenever they had met of late she had been subject
to these rushes of obscure hostility, the half-physical,
half-moral shrinking from some indefinable element in
his nature against which she was constrained to defend
herself by perpetual pleasantry and evasion?</p>

<p>To Wyant, at any rate, the answer was not far to
seek. His pale face reflected the disdain in hers as he
returned ironically: "A thousand pardons; I know I'm
not always in the key."</p>

<p>"The key?"</p>

<p>"I haven't yet acquired the Lynbrook tone. You
must make allowances for my lack of opportunity."</p>

<p>The retort on Justine's lips dropped to silence, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[p 241]</a></span>
though his words had in fact brought an answer to her
inward questioning. Could it be that he was right&mdash;that
her shrinking from him was the result of an increased
sensitiveness to faults of taste that she would
once have despised herself for noticing? When she had
first known him, in her work at St. Elizabeth's some
three years earlier, his excesses of manner had seemed
to her merely the boyish tokens of a richness of nature
not yet controlled by experience. Though Wyant was
somewhat older than herself there had always been an
element of protection in her feeling for him, and it was
perhaps this element which formed the real ground of
her liking. It was, at any rate, uppermost as she returned,
with a softened gleam of mockery: "Since you
are so sure of my answer I hardly know why I should
see you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You mean me to take it now?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I don't mean you to take it at all till it's given&mdash;above
all not to take it for granted!"</p>

<p>His jutting brows drew together again. "Ah, I can't
split hairs with you. Won't you put me out of my
misery?"</p>

<p>She smiled, but not unkindly. "Do you want an
an&aelig;sthetic?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;a clean cut with the knife!"</p>

<p>"You forget that we're not allowed to despatch hopeless
cases&mdash;more's the pity!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[p 242]</a></span></p>

<p>He flushed to the roots of his thin hair. "Hopeless
cases? That's it, then&mdash;that's my answer?"</p>

<p>They had reached the point where, at the farther
edge of the straggling settlement, the tiled roof of the
railway-station fronted the post-office cupola; and the
shriek of a whistle now reminded Justine that the spot
was not propitious to private talk. She halted a moment
before speaking.</p>

<p>"I have no answer to give you now but the one in
my note&mdash;that I'll see you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"But if you're sure of knowing tomorrow you must
know now!"</p>

<p>Their eyes met, his eloquently pleading, hers kind
but still impenetrable. "If I knew now, you should
know too. Please be content with that," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"How can I be, when a day may make such a difference?
When I know that every influence about you
is fighting against me?"</p>

<p>The words flashed a refracted light far down into
the causes of her own uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, drawing a little away from him,
"I'm not so sure that I don't like a fight!"</p>

<p>"Is that why you won't give in?" He moved toward
her with a despairing gesture. "If I let you go now,
you're lost to me!"</p>

<p>She stood her ground, facing him with a quick lift of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[p 243]</a></span>
the head. "If you don't let me go I certainly am," she
said; and he drew back, as if conscious of the uselessness
of the struggle. His submission, as usual, had a
disarming effect on her irritation, and she held out her
hand. "Come tomorrow at three," she said, her voice
and manner suddenly seeming to give back the hope
she had withheld from him.</p>

<p>He seized on her hand with an inarticulate murmur;
but at the same moment a louder whistle and the
thunder of an approaching train reminded her of the
impossibility of prolonging the scene. She was ordinarily
careless of appearances, but while she was Mrs.
Amherst's guest she did not care to be seen romantically
loitering through the twilight with Stephen Wyant;
and she freed herself with a quick goodbye.</p>

<p>He gave her a last look, hesitating and imploring;
then, in obedience to her gesture, he turned away and
strode off in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left her she began to retrace her
steps toward Lynbrook House; but instead of traversing
the whole length of the village she passed through a
turnstile in the park fencing, taking a more circuitous
but quieter way home.</p>

<p>She walked on slowly through the dusk, wishing to
give herself time to think over her conversation with
Wyant. Now that she was alone again, it seemed to
her that the part she had played had been both incon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[p 244]</a></span>sistent
and undignified. When she had written to
Wyant that she would see him on the morrow she had
done so with the clear understanding that she was to
give, at that meeting, a definite answer to his offer of
marriage; and during her talk with Bessy she had suddenly,
and, as it seemed to her, irrevocably, decided
that the answer should be favourable. From the first
days of her acquaintance with Wyant she had appreciated
his intelligence and had been stimulated by his
zeal for his work. He had remained only six months
at Saint Elizabeth's, and though his feeling for her had
even then been manifest, it had been kept from expression
by the restraint of their professional relation, and
by her absorption in her duties. It was only when
they had met again at Lynbrook that she had begun to
feel a personal interest in him. His youthful promise
seemed nearer fulfillment than she had once thought
possible, and the contrast he presented to the young
men in Bessy's train was really all in his favour. He
had gained in strength and steadiness without losing
his high flashes of enthusiasm; and though, even now,
she was not in love with him, she began to feel that the
union of their common interests might create a life
full and useful enough to preclude the possibility of
vague repinings. It would, at any rate, take her out
of the stagnant circle of her present existence, and restore
her to contact with the fruitful energies of life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[p 245]</a></span></p>

<p>All this had seemed quite clear when she wrote her
letter; why, then, had she not made use of their chance
encounter to give her answer, instead of capriciously
postponing it? The act might have been that of a
self-conscious girl in her teens; but neither inexperience
nor coquetry had prompted it. She had merely yielded
to the spirit of resistance that Wyant's presence had of
late aroused in her; and the possibility that this resistance
might be due to some sense of his social defects,
his lack of measure and facility, was so humiliating
that for a moment she stood still in the path, half-meaning
to turn back and overtake him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As she paused she was surprised to hear a man's
step behind her; and the thought that it might be
Wyant's brought about another revulsion of feeling.
What right had he to pursue her in this way, to dog her
steps even into the Lynbrook grounds? She was sure
that his persistent attentions had already attracted the
notice of Bessy's visitors; and that he should thus force
himself on her after her dismissal seemed suddenly to
make their whole relation ridiculous.</p>

<p>She turned about to rebuke him, and found herself
face to face with John Amherst.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[p 246]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amherst</span>, on leaving the train at Lynbrook, had
paused in doubt on the empty platform. His
return was unexpected, and no carriage awaited him;
but he caught the signal of the village cab-driver's ready
whip. Amherst, however, felt a sudden desire to postpone
the moment of arrival, and consigning his luggage
to the cab he walked away toward the turnstile through
which Justine had passed. In thus taking the longest
way home he was yielding another point to his reluctance.
He knew that at that hour his wife's visitors
might still be assembled in the drawing-room, and he
wished to avoid making his unannounced entrance
among them.</p>

<p>It was not till now that he felt the embarrassment
of such an arrival. For some time past he had
known that he ought to go back to Lynbrook, but he
had not known how to tell Bessy that he was coming.
Lack of habit made him inexpert in the art of easy
transitions, and his inability to bridge over awkward
gaps had often put him at a disadvantage with his wife
and her friends. He had not yet learned the importance
of observing the forms which made up the daily
ceremonial of their lives, and at present there was just
enough soreness between himself and Bessy to make
such observances more difficult than usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[p 247]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been no open estrangement, but peace had
been preserved at the cost of a slowly accumulated tale
of grievances on both sides. Since Amherst had won his
point about the mills, the danger he had foreseen had
been realized: his victory at Westmore had been a
defeat at Lynbrook. It would be too crude to say that
his wife had made him pay for her public concession
by the private disregard of his wishes; and if something
of this sort had actually resulted, his sense of
fairness told him that it was merely the natural reaction
of a soft nature against the momentary strain of self-denial.
At first he had been hardly aware of this consequence
of his triumph. The joy of being able to
work his will at Westmore obscured all lesser emotions;
and his sentiment for Bessy had long since shrunk into
one of those shallow pools of feeling which a sudden
tide might fill, but which could never again be the deep
perennial spring from which his life was fed.</p>

<p>The need of remaining continuously at Hanaford
while the first changes were making had increased the
strain of the situation. He had never expected that
Bessy would stay there with him&mdash;had perhaps, at heart,
hardly wished it&mdash;and her plan of going to the Adirondacks
with Miss Brent seemed to him a satisfactory
alternative to the European trip she had renounced.
He felt as relieved as though some one had taken off his
hands the task of amusing a restless child, and he let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[p 248]</a></span>
his wife go without suspecting that the moment might
be a decisive one between them. But it had not occurred
to Bessy that any one could regard six weeks in
the Adirondacks as an adequate substitute for a summer
abroad. She felt that her sacrifice deserved recognition,
and personal devotion was the only form of recognition
which could satisfy her. She had expected Amherst
to join her at the camp, but he did not come; and
when she went back to Long Island she did not stop to
see him, though Hanaford lay in her way. At the
moment of her return the work at the mills made it
impossible for him to go to Lynbrook; and thus the
weeks drifted on without their meeting.</p>

<p>At last, urged by his mother, he had gone down to
Long Island for a night; but though, on that occasion,
he had announced his coming, he found the house full,
and the whole party except Mr. Langhope in the act
of starting off to a dinner in the neighbourhood. He
was of course expected to go too, and Bessy appeared
hurt when he declared that he was too tired and preferred
to remain with Mr. Langhope; but she did not
suggest staying at home herself, and drove off in a
mood of exuberant gaiety. Amherst had been too busy
all his life to know what intricacies of perversion a sentimental
grievance may develop in an unoccupied mind,
and he saw in Bessy's act only a sign of indifference.
The next day she complained to him of money difficul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[p 249]</a></span>ties,
as though surprised that her income had been
suddenly cut down; and when he reminded her that
she had consented of her own will to this temporary reduction,
she burst into tears and accused him of caring
only for Westmore.</p>

<p>He went away exasperated by her inconsequence, and
bills from Lynbrook continued to pour in on him. In
the first days of their marriage, Bessy had put him in
charge of her exchequer, and she was too indolent&mdash;and
at heart perhaps too sensitive&mdash;to ask him to renounce
the charge. It was clear to him, therefore, how little
she was observing the spirit of their compact, and his
mind was tormented by the anticipation of financial
embarrassments. He wrote her a letter of gentle expostulation,
but in her answer she ignored his remonstrance;
and after that silence fell between them.</p>

<p>The only way to break this silence was to return to
Lynbrook; but now that he had come back, he did not
know what step to take next. Something in the atmosphere
of his wife's existence seemed to paralyze his
will-power. When all about her spoke a language so
different from his own, how could he hope to make
himself heard? He knew that her family and her
immediate friends&mdash;Mr. Langhope, the Gaineses, Mrs.
Ansell and Mr. Tredegar&mdash;far from being means of
communication, were so many sentinels ready to raise
the drawbridge and drop the portcullis at his ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[p 250]</a></span>proach.
They were all in league to stifle the incipient
feelings he had roused in Bessy, to push her back
into the deadening routine of her former life, and the
only voice that might conceivably speak for him was
Miss Brent's.</p>

<p>The "case" which, unexpectedly presented to her by
one of the Hope Hospital physicians, had detained Justine
at Hanaford during the month of June, was the
means of establishing a friendship between herself and
Amherst. They did not meet often, or get to know each
other very well; but he saw her occasionally at his
mother's and at Mrs. Dressel's, and once he took her
out to Westmore, to consult her about the emergency
hospital which was to be included among the first improvements
there. The expedition had been memorable
to both; and when, some two weeks later, Bessy
wrote suggesting that she should take Miss Brent to
the Adirondacks, it seemed to Amherst that there was
no one whom he would rather have his wife choose as
her companion.</p>

<p>He was much too busy at the time to cultivate or
analyze his feeling for Miss Brent; he rested vaguely in
the thought of her, as of the "nicest" girl he had ever
met, and was frankly pleased when accident brought
them together; but the seeds left in both their minds
by these chance encounters had not yet begun to germinate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[p 251]</a></span></p>

<p>So unperceived had been their gradual growth in
intimacy that it was a surprise to Amherst to find himself
suddenly thinking of her as a means of communication
with his wife; but the thought gave him such encouragement
that, when he saw Justine in the path
before him he went toward her with unusual eagerness.</p>

<p>Justine, on her part, felt an equal pleasure. She
knew that Bessy did not expect her husband, and that
his prolonged absence had already been the cause of
malicious comment at Lynbrook; and she caught at
the hope that this sudden return might betoken a more
favourable turn of affairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to see you!" she exclaimed; and
her tone had the effect of completing his reassurance,
his happy sense that she would understand and help
him.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you too," he began confusedly;
then, conscious of the intimacy of the phrase, he added
with a slight laugh: "The fact is, I'm a culprit looking
for a peace-maker."</p>

<p>"A culprit?"</p>

<p>"I've been so tied down at the mills that I didn't
know, till yesterday, just when I could break away;
and in the hurry of leaving&mdash;" He paused again,
checked by the impossibility of uttering, to the girl
before him, the little conventional falsehoods which
formed the small currency of Bessy's circle. Not that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[p 252]</a></span>
any scruple of probity restrained him: in trifling matters
he recognized the usefulness of such counters in
the social game; but when he was with Justine he
always felt the obscure need of letting his real self be
seen.</p>

<p>"I was stupid enough not to telegraph," he said,
"and I am afraid my wife will think me negligent: she
often has to reproach me for my sins of omission, and
this time I know they are many."</p>

<p>The girl received this in silence, less from embarrassment
than from surprise; for she had already
guessed that it was as difficult for Amherst to touch,
even lightly, on his private affairs, as it was instinctive
with his wife to pour her grievances into any willing ear.
Justine's first thought was one of gratification that he
should have spoken, and of eagerness to facilitate the
saying of whatever he wished to say; but before she
could answer he went on hastily: "The fact is, Bessy
does not know how complicated the work at Westmore
is; and when I caught sight of you just now I was
thinking that you are the only one of her friends who
has any technical understanding of what I am trying
to do, and who might consequently help her to see how
hard it is for me to take my hand from the plough."</p>

<p>Justine listened gravely, longing to cry out her comprehension
and sympathy, but restrained by the sense
that the moment was a critical one, where impulse must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[p 253]</a></span>
not be trusted too far. It was quite possible that a reaction
of pride might cause Amherst to repent even so
guarded an avowal; and if that happened, he might
never forgive her for having encouraged him to speak.
She looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"Why not tell Bessy yourself? Your understanding
of the case is a good deal clearer than mine or any one
else's."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bessy is tired of hearing about it from me; and
besides&mdash;" She detected a shade of disappointment in
his tone, and was sorry she had said anything which
might seem meant to discourage his confidence. It
occurred to her also that she had been insincere in not
telling him at once that she had already been let into
the secret of his domestic differences: she felt the same
craving as Amherst for absolute openness between
them.</p>

<p>"I know," she said, almost timidly, "that Bessy has
not been quite content of late to have you give so much
time to Westmore, and perhaps she herself thinks it is
because the work there does not interest her; but I
believe it is for a different reason."</p>

<p>"What reason?" he asked with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>"Because Westmore takes you from her; because she
thinks you are happier there than at Lynbrook."</p>

<p>The day had faded so rapidly that it was no longer
possible for the speakers to see each other's faces, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[p 254]</a></span>
it was easier for both to communicate through the veil
of deepening obscurity.</p>

<p>"But, good heavens, she might be there with me&mdash;she's
as much needed there as I am!" Amherst exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes; but you must remember that it's against all
her habits&mdash;and against the point of view of every one
about her&mdash;that she should lead that kind of life; and
meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, isn't it expedient that you should, a
little more, lead hers?"</p>

<p>Always the same answer to his restless questioning!
His mother's answer, the answer of Bessy and her
friends. He had somehow hoped that the girl at his side
would find a different solution to the problem, and his
disappointment escaped in a bitter exclamation.</p>

<p>"But Westmore is my life&mdash;hers too, if she knew it!
I can't desert it now without being as false to her as
to myself!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he was overcome once more by the
hopelessness of trying to put his case clearly. How
could Justine, for all her quickness and sympathy,
understand a situation of which the deeper elements
were necessarily unknown to her? The advice she
gave him was natural enough, and on her lips it seemed
not the counsel of a shallow expediency, but the plea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[p 255]</a></span>
compassion and understanding. But she knew nothing
of the long struggle for mutual adjustment which had
culminated in this crisis between himself and his wife,
and she could therefore not see that, if he yielded his
point, and gave up his work at Westmore, the concession
would mean not renewal but destruction. He felt
that he should hate Bessy if he won her back at that
price; and the violence of his feeling frightened him.
It was, in truth, as he had said, his own life that he
was fighting for. If he gave up Westmore he could not
fall back on the futile activities of Lynbrook, and fate
might yet have some lower alternative to offer. He
could trust to his own strength and self-command while
his energies had a normal outlet; but idleness and
self-indulgence might work in him like a dangerous
drug.</p>

<p>Justine kept steadily to her point. "Westmore must
be foremost to both of you in time; I don't see how
either of you can escape that. But the realization of
it must come to Bessy through <i>you</i>, and for that reason
I think that you ought to be more patient&mdash;that you
ought even to put the question aside for a time and
enter a little more into her life while she is learning to
understand yours." As she ended, it seemed to her
that what she had said was trite and ineffectual, and
yet that it might have passed the measure of discretion;
and, torn between two doubts, she added hastily:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[p 256]</a></span>
"But you have done just that in coming back now&mdash;that
is the real solution of the problem."</p>

<p>While she spoke they passed out of the wood-path
they had been following, and rounding a mass of shrubbery
emerged on the lawn below the terraces. The
long bulk of the house lay above them, dark against the
lingering gleam of the west, with brightly-lit windows
marking its irregular outline; and the sight produced
in Amherst and Justine a vague sense of helplessness
and constraint. It was impossible to speak with the
same freedom, confronted by that substantial symbol
of the accepted order, which seemed to glare down on
them in massive disdain of their puny efforts to deflect
the course of events: and Amherst, without reverting
to her last words, asked after a moment if his wife
had many guests.</p>

<p>He listened in silence while Justine ran over the list
of names&mdash;the Telfer girls and their brother, Mason
Winch and Westy Gaines, a cluster of young bridge-playing
couples, and, among the last arrivals, the
Fenton Carburys and Ned Bowfort. The names were
all familiar to Amherst&mdash;he knew they represented the
flower of week-end fashion; but he did not remember
having seen the Carburys among his wife's guests, and
his mind paused on the name, seeking to regain some
lost impression connected with it. But it evoked, like
the others, merely the confused sense of stridency and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[p 257]</a></span>
unrest which he had brought away from his last Lynbrook
visit; and this reminiscence made him ask Miss
Brent, when her list was ended, if she did not think
that so continuous a succession of visitors was too
tiring for Bessy.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think it tires her more than she knows;
but I hope she can be persuaded to take better care of
herself now that Mrs. Ansell has come back."</p>

<p>Amherst halted abruptly. "Is Mrs. Ansell here?"</p>

<p>"She arrived from Europe today."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Langhope too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He came from Newport about ten days ago."</p>

<p>Amherst checked himself, conscious that his questions
betrayed the fact that he and his wife no longer
wrote to each other. The same thought appeared to
strike Justine, and they walked across the lawn in
silence, hastening their steps involuntarily, as though to
escape the oppressive weight of the words which had
passed between them. But Justine was unwilling that
this fruitless sense of oppression should be the final
outcome of their talk; and when they reached the
upper terrace she paused and turned impulsively to
Amherst. As she did so, the light from an uncurtained
window fell on her face, which glowed with the inner
brightness kindled in it by moments of strong feeling.</p>

<p>"I am sure of one thing&mdash;Bessy will be very, very
glad that you have come," she exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[p 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered.</p>

<p>Their hands met mechanically, and she turned away
and entered the house.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bessy</span> had not seen her little girl that day, and
filled with compunction by Justine's reminder,
she hastened directly to the school-room.</p>

<p>Of late, in certain moods, her maternal tenderness
had been clouded by a sense of uneasiness in the child's
presence, for Cicely was the argument most effectually
used by Mr. Langhope and Mr. Tredegar in their
efforts to check the triumph of Amherst's ideas. Bessy,
still unable to form an independent opinion on the
harassing question of the mills, continued to oscillate
between the views of the contending parties, now regarding
Cicely as an innocent victim and herself as an
unnatural mother, sacrificing her child's prospects to
further Amherst's enterprise, and now conscious of a
vague animosity against the little girl, as the chief cause
of the dissensions which had so soon clouded the skies
of her second marriage. Then again, there were moments
when Cicely's rosy bloom reminded her bitterly
of the child she had lost&mdash;the son on whom her
ambitions had been fixed. It seemed to her now that
if their boy had lived she might have kept Amherst's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[p 259]</a></span>
love and have played a more important part in his life;
and brooding on the tragedy of the child's sickly existence
she resented the contrast of Cicely's brightness and
vigour. The result was that in her treatment of her
daughter she alternated between moments of exaggerated
devotion and days of neglect, never long happy
away from the little girl, yet restless and self-tormenting
in her presence.</p>

<p>After her talk with Justine she felt more than usually
disturbed, as she always did when her unprofitable
impulses of self-exposure had subsided. Bessy's mind
was not made for introspection, and chance had burdened
it with unintelligible problems. She felt herself
the victim of circumstances to which her imagination
attributed the deliberate malice that children ascribe
to the furniture they run against in playing. This
helped her to cultivate a sense of helpless injury and
to disdain in advance the advice she was perpetually
seeking. How absurd it was, for instance, to suppose
that a girl could understand the feelings of a married
woman! Justine's suggestion that she should humble
herself still farther to Amherst merely left in Bessy's
mind a rankling sense of being misunderstood and
undervalued by those to whom she turned in her extremity,
and she said to herself, in a phrase that sounded
well in her own ears, that sooner or later every woman
must learn to fight her battles alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[p 260]</a></span></p>

<p>In this mood she entered the room where Cicely was
at supper with her governess, and enveloped the child
in a whirl of passionate caresses. But Cicely had inherited
the soberer Westmore temper, and her mother's
spasmodic endearments always had a repressive effect
on her. She dutifully returned a small fraction of
Bessy's kisses, and then, with an air of relief, addressed
herself once more to her bread and marmalade.</p>

<p>"You don't seem a bit glad to see me!" Bessy exclaimed,
while the little governess made a nervous pretence
of being greatly amused at this prodigious paradox,
and Cicely, setting down her silver mug, asked
judicially: "Why should I be gladder than other days?
It isn't a birthday."</p>

<p>This Cordelia-like answer cut Bessy to the quick.
"You horrid child to say such a cruel thing when you
know I love you better and better every minute! But
you don't care for me any longer because Justine has
taken you away from me!"</p>

<p>This last charge had sprung into her mind in the act
of uttering it, but now that it was spoken it instantly
assumed the proportions of a fact, and seemed to furnish
another justification for her wretchedness. Bessy
was not naturally jealous, but her imagination was
thrall to the spoken word, and it gave her a sudden incomprehensible
relief to associate Justine with the
obscure causes of her suffering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[p 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know she's cleverer than I am, and more amusing,
and can tell you about plants and animals and
things...and I daresay she tells you how tiresome
and stupid I am...."</p>

<p>She sprang up suddenly, abashed by Cicely's astonished
gaze, and by the governess's tremulous attempt to
continue to treat the scene as one of "Mamma's"
most successful pleasantries.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me&mdash;my head aches horribly. I think
I'll rush off for a gallop on Impulse before dinner. Miss
Dill, Cicely's nails are a sight&mdash;I suppose that comes of
grubbing up wild-flowers."</p>

<p>And with this parting shot at Justine's pursuits she
swept out of the school-room, leaving pupil and teacher
plunged in a stricken silence from which Cicely at
length emerged to say, with the candour that Miss Dill
dreaded more than any punishable offense: "Mother's
prettiest&mdash;but I do like Justine the best."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was nearly dark when Bessy mounted the horse
which had been hastily saddled in response to her order;
but it was her habit to ride out alone at all hours, and of
late nothing but a hard gallop had availed to quiet her
nerves. Her craving for occupation had increased as her
life became more dispersed and agitated, and the need
to fill every hour drove her to excesses of bodily exertion,
since other forms of activity were unknown to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[p 262]</a></span></p>

<p>As she cantered along under the twilight sky, with a
strong sea-breeze in her face, the rush of air and the
effort of steadying her nervous thoroughbred filled her
with a glow of bodily energy from which her thoughts
emerged somewhat cleansed of their bitterness.</p>

<p>She had been odious to poor little Cicely, for whom
she now felt a sudden remorseful yearning which almost
made her turn her horse's head homeward, that she
might dash upstairs and do penance beside the child's
bed. And that she should have accused Justine of
taking Cicely from her! It frightened her to find herself
thinking evil of Justine. Bessy, whose perceptions
were keen enough in certain directions, knew that her
second marriage had changed her relation to all her
former circle of friends. Though they still rallied about
her, keeping up the convenient habit of familiar intercourse,
she had begun to be aware that their view of
her had in it an element of criticism and compassion.
She had once fancied that Amherst's good looks, and
the other qualities she had seen in him, would immediately
make him free of the charmed circle in which
she moved; but she was discouraged by his disregard
of his opportunities, and above all by the fundamental
differences in his view of life. He was never common
or ridiculous, but she saw that he would never acquire
the small social facilities. He was fond of exercise,
but it bored him to talk of it. The men's smoking-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[p 263]</a></span>room
anecdotes did not amuse him, he was unmoved
by the fluctuations of the stock-market, he could not
tell one card from another, and his perfunctory attempts
at billiards had once caused Mr. Langhope to
murmur, in his daughter's hearing: "Ah, that's the
test&mdash;I always said so!"</p>

<p>Thus debarred from what seemed to Bessy the chief
points of contact with life, how could Amherst hope to
impose himself on minds versed in these larger relations?
As the sense of his social insufficiency grew
on her, Bessy became more sensitive to that latent
criticism of her marriage which&mdash;intolerable thought!&mdash;involved
a judgment on herself. She was increasingly
eager for the approval and applause of her little audience,
yet increasingly distrustful of their sincerity, and
more miserably persuaded that she and her husband
were the butt of some of their most effective stories.
She knew also that rumours of the disagreement about
Westmore were abroad, and the suspicion that Amherst's
conduct was the subject of unfriendly comment
provoked in her a reaction of loyalty to his ideas....</p>

<p>From this turmoil of conflicting influences only her
friendship with Justine Brent remained secure. Though
Justine's adaptability made it easy for her to fit into
the Lynbrook life, Bessy knew that she stood as much
outside of it as Amherst. She could never, for instance,
be influenced by what Maria Ansell and the Gaineses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[p 264]</a></span>
and the Telfers thought. She had her own criteria of
conduct, unintelligible to Bessy, but giving her an independence
of mind on which her friend leaned in a
kind of blind security. And that even her faith in
Justine should suddenly be poisoned by a jealous
thought seemed to prove that the consequences of her
marriage were gradually infecting her whole life. Bessy
could conceive of masculine devotion only as subservient
to its divinity's least wish, and she argued that
if Amherst had really loved her he could not so lightly
have disturbed the foundations of her world. And so
her tormented thoughts, perpetually circling on themselves,
reverted once more to their central grievance&mdash;the
failure of her marriage. If her own love had died
out it would have been much simpler&mdash;she was surrounded
by examples of the mutual evasion of a troublesome
tie. There was Blanche Carbury, for instance,
with whom she had lately struck up an absorbing
friendship...it was perfectly clear that Blanche Carbury
wondered how much more she was going to
stand! But it was the torment of Bessy's situation
that it involved a radical contradiction, that she still
loved Amherst though she could not forgive him for
having married her.</p>

<p>Perhaps what she most suffered from was his too-prompt
acceptance of the semi-estrangement between
them. After nearly three years of marriage she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[p 265]</a></span>
still to learn that it was Amherst's way to wrestle with
the angel till dawn, and then to go about his other
business. Her own mind could revolve in the same
grievance as interminably as a squirrel in its wheel,
and her husband's habit of casting off the accepted fact
seemed to betoken poverty of feeling. If only he had
striven a little harder to keep her&mdash;if, even now, he
would come back to her, and make her feel that she
was more to him than those wretched mills!</p>

<p>When she turned her mare toward Lynbrook, the
longing to see Amherst was again uppermost. He had
not written for weeks&mdash;she had been obliged to tell
Maria Ansell that she knew nothing of his plans, and
it mortified her to think that every one was aware of
his neglect. Yet, even now, if on reaching the house
she should find a telegram to say that he was coming,
the weight of loneliness would be lifted, and everything
in life would seem different....</p>

<p>Her high-strung mare, scenting the homeward road,
and excited by the fantastic play of wayside lights and
shadows, swept her along at a wild gallop with which
the fevered rush of her thoughts kept pace, and when
she reached the house she dropped from the saddle with
aching wrists and brain benumbed.</p>

<p>She entered by a side door, to avoid meeting any one,
and ran upstairs at once, knowing that she had barely
time to dress for dinner. As she opened the door of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[p 266]</a></span>
her sitting-room some one rose from the chair by the
fire, and she stood still, facing her husband....</p>

<p>It was the moment both had desired, yet when it
came it found them tongue-tied and helpless.</p>

<p>Bessy was the first to speak. "When did you get
here? You never wrote me you were coming!"</p>

<p>Amherst advanced toward her, holding out his hand.
"No; you must forgive me. I have been very busy,"
he said.</p>

<p>Always the same excuse! The same thrusting at her
of the hateful fact that Westmore came first, and that
she must put up with whatever was left of his time and
thoughts!</p>

<p>"You are always too busy to let me hear from you,"
she said coldly, and the hand which had sprung toward
his fell back to her side.</p>

<p>Even then, if he had only said frankly: "It was too
difficult&mdash;I didn't know how," the note of truth would
have reached and moved her; but he had striven for the
tone of ease and self-restraint that was habitual among
her friends, and as usual his attempt had been a failure.</p>

<p>"I am sorry&mdash;I'm a bad hand at writing," he rejoined;
and his evil genius prompted him to add: "I
hope my coming is not inconvenient?"</p>

<p>The colour rose to Bessy's face. "Of course not.
But it must seem rather odd to our visitors that I should
know so little of your plans."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[p 267]</a></span></p>

<p>At this he humbled himself still farther. "I know I
don't think enough about appearances&mdash;I'll try to do
better the next time."</p>

<p>Appearances! He spoke as if she had been reproaching
him for a breach of etiquette...it never
occurred to him that the cry came from her humiliated
heart! The tide of warmth that always enveloped her
in his presence was receding, and in its place a chill
fluid seemed to creep up slowly to her throat and lips.</p>

<p>In Amherst, meanwhile, the opposite process was
taking place. His wife was still to him the most beautiful
woman in the world, or rather, perhaps, the only
woman to whose beauty his eyes had been opened.
That beauty could never again penetrate to his heart,
but it still touched his senses, not with passion but with
a caressing kindliness, such as one might feel for the
bright movements of a bird or a kitten. It seemed to
plead with him not to ask of her more than she could
give&mdash;to be content with the outward grace and not
seek in it an inner meaning. He moved toward her
again, and took her passive hands in his.</p>

<p>"You look tired. Why do you ride so late?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just wanted to give Impulse a gallop. I
hadn't time to take her out earlier, and if I let the
grooms exercise her they'll spoil her mouth."</p>

<p>Amherst frowned. "You ought not to ride that mare
alone at night. She shies at everything after dark."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[p 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's the only horse I care for&mdash;the others are all
cows," she murmured, releasing her hands impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, you must take me with you the next time you
ride her."</p>

<p>She softened a little, in spite of herself. Riding was
the only amusement he cared to share with her, and the
thought of a long gallop across the plains at his side
brought back the warmth to her veins.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll go tomorrow. How long do you mean
to stay?" she asked, looking up at him eagerly.</p>

<p>He was pleased that she should wish to know, yet
the question embarrassed him, for it was necessary that
he should be back at Westmore within three days, and
he could not put her off with an evasion.</p>

<p>Bessy saw his hesitation, and her colour rose again.
"I only asked," she explained, "because there is to
be a fancy ball at the Hunt Club on the twentieth,
and I thought of giving a big dinner here first."</p>

<p>Amherst did not understand that she too had her inarticulate
moments, and that the allusion to the fancy
ball was improvised to hide an eagerness to which
he had been too slow in responding. He thought she
had enquired about his plans only that he might not
again interfere with the arrangements of her dinner-table.
If that was all she cared about, it became suddenly
easy to tell her that he could not stay, and he
answered lightly: "Fancy balls are a little out of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[p 269]</a></span>
line; but at any rate I shall have to be back at the mills
the day after tomorrow."</p>

<p>The disappointment brought a rush of bitterness to
her lips. "The day after tomorrow? It seems hardly
worth while to have come so far for two days!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind the journey&mdash;and there are one
or two matters I must consult you about."</p>

<p>There could hardly have been a more ill-advised
answer, but Amherst was reckless now. If she cared
for his coming only that he might fill a place at a fancy-dress
dinner, he would let her see that he had come only
because he had to go through the form of submitting to
her certain measures to be taken at Westmore.</p>

<p>Bessy was beginning to feel the physical reaction of
her struggle with the mare. The fatigue which at first
had deadened her nerves now woke them to acuter sensibility,
and an appealing word from her husband
would have drawn her to his arms. But his answer
seemed to drive all the blood back to her heart.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you still go through the form of
consulting me about Westmore, when you have always
done just as you pleased there, without regard to me
or Cicely."</p>

<p>Amherst made no answer, silenced by the discouragement
of hearing the same old grievance on her lips;
and she too seemed struck, after she had spoken, by
the unprofitableness of such retorts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[p 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't matter&mdash;of course I'll do whatever you
wish," she went on listlessly. "But I could have sent
my signature, if that is all you came for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Amherst coldly. "I shall remember
that the next time."</p>

<p>They stood silent for a moment, he with his eyes fixed
on her, she with averted head, twisting her riding-whip
between her fingers; then she said suddenly: "We
shall be late for dinner," and passing into her dressing-room
she closed the door.</p>

<p>Amherst roused himself as she disappeared.</p>

<p>"Bessy!" he exclaimed, moving toward her; but as
he approached the door he heard her maid's voice
within, and turning away he went to his own room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Bessy came down late to dinner, with vivid cheeks and
an air of improvised ease; and the manner of her entrance,
combined with her husband's unannounced
arrival, produced in their observant guests the sense of
latent complications. Mr. Langhope, though evidently
unaware of his son-in-law's return till they greeted each
other in the drawing-room, was too good a card-player
to betray surprise, and Mrs. Ansell outdid herself in
the delicate art of taking everything for granted; but
these very dissimulations sharpened the perception of
the other guests, whom long practice had rendered
expert in interpreting such signs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[p 271]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all this Justine Brent was aware; and conscious
also that, by every one but herself, the suspected estrangement
between the Amhersts was regarded as
turning merely on the question of money. To the
greater number of persons present there was, in fact,
no other conceivable source of conjugal discord, since
every known complication could be adjusted by means
of the universal lubricant. It was this unanimity of
view which bound together in the compactness of a
new feudalism the members of Bessy Amherst's world;
which supplied them with their pass-words and social
tests, and defended them securely against the insidious
attack of ideas.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Genius of History, capriciously directing the antics
of its marionettes, sometimes lets the drama languish
through a series of unrelated episodes, and then, suddenly
quickening the pace, packs into one scene the
stuff of a dozen. The chance meeting of Amherst and
Justine, seemingly of no significance to either, contained
the germ of developments of which both had
begun to be aware before the evening was over. Their
short talk&mdash;the first really intimate exchange of words
between them&mdash;had the effect of creating a sense of
solidarity that grew apace in the atmosphere of the
Lynbrook dinner-table.</p>

<p>Justine was always reluctant to take part in Bessy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[p 272]</a></span>
week-end dinners, but as she descended the stairs that
evening she did not regret having promised to be
present. She frankly wanted to see Amherst again&mdash;his
tone, his view of life, reinforced her own convictions,
restored her faith in the reality and importance of all
that Lynbrook ignored and excluded. Her extreme
sensitiveness to surrounding vibrations of thought and
feeling told her, as she glanced at him between the
flowers and candles of the long dinner-table, that he
too was obscurely aware of the same effect; and it
flashed across her that they were unconsciously drawn
together by the fact that they were the only two strangers
in the room. Every one else had the same standpoint,
spoke the same language, drew on the same stock of
allusions, used the same weights and measures in estimating
persons and actions. Between Mr. Langhope's
indolent acuteness of mind and the rudimentary processes
of the rosy Telfers there was a difference of
degree but not of kind. If Mr. Langhope viewed the
spectacle more objectively, it was not because he had
outlived the sense of its importance, but because years
of experience had familiarized him with its minutest
details; and this familiarity with the world he lived in
had bred a profound contempt for any other.</p>

<p>In no way could the points of contact between Amherst
and Justine Brent have been more vividly brought
out than by their tacit exclusion from the currents of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[p 273]</a></span>
opinion about them. Amherst, seated in unsmiling endurance
at the foot of the table, between Mrs. Ansell,
with her carefully-distributed affabilities, and Blanche
Carbury, with her reckless hurling of conversational
pebbles, seemed to Justine as much of a stranger as
herself among the people to whom his marriage had
introduced him. So strongly did she feel the sense of
their common isolation that it was no surprise to her,
when the men reappeared in the drawing-room after
dinner, to have her host thread his way, between the
unfolding bridge-tables, straight to the corner where
she sat. Amherst's methods in the drawing-room were
still as direct as in the cotton-mill. He always went up
at once to the person he sought, without preliminary
waste of tactics; and on this occasion Justine, without
knowing what had passed between himself and Bessy,
suspected from the appearance of both that their talk
had resulted in increasing Amherst's desire to be with
some one to whom he could speak freely and naturally
on the subject nearest his heart.</p>

<p>She began at once to question him about Westmore,
and the change in his face showed that his work was
still a refuge from all that made life disheartening and
unintelligible. Whatever convictions had been thwarted
or impaired in him, his faith in the importance of his
task remained unshaken; and the firmness with which
he held to it filled Justine with a sense of his strength.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[p 274]</a></span>
The feeling kindled her own desire to escape again into
the world of deeds, yet by a sudden reaction it checked
the growing inclination for Stephen Wyant that had
resulted from her revolt against Lynbrook. Here was
a man as careless as Wyant of the minor forms, yet
her appreciation of him was not affected by the lack of
adaptability that she accused herself of criticizing in
her suitor. She began to see that it was not the sense
of Wyant's social deficiencies that had held her back;
and the discovery at once set free her judgment of him,
enabling her to penetrate to the real causes of her
reluctance. She understood now that the flaw she felt
was far deeper than any defect of manner. It was the
sense in him of something unstable and incalculable,
something at once weak and violent, that was brought
to light by the contrast of Amherst's quiet resolution.
Here was a man whom no gusts of chance could deflect
from his purpose; while she felt that the career to
which Wyant had so ardently given himself would
always be at the mercy of his passing emotions.</p>

<p>As the distinction grew clearer, Justine trembled to
think that she had so nearly pledged herself, without
the excuse of love, to a man whose failings she
could judge so lucidly.... But had she ever really
thought of marrying Wyant? While she continued to
talk with Amherst such a possibility became more and
more remote, till she began to feel it was no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[p 275]</a></span>
than a haunting dream. But her promise to see Wyant
the next day reminded her of the nearness of her peril.
How could she have played with her fate so lightly&mdash;she,
who held her life so dear because she felt in it such
untried powers of action and emotion? She continued to
listen to Amherst's account of his work, with enough
outward self-possession to place the right comment
and put the right question, yet conscious only of the
quiet strength she was absorbing from his presence, of
the way in which his words, his voice, his mere nearness
were slowly steadying and clarifying her will.</p>

<p>In the smoking-room, after the ladies had gone upstairs,
Amherst continued to acquit himself mechanically
of his duties, against the incongruous back-ground
of his predecessor's remarkable sporting-prints&mdash;for it
was characteristic of his relation to Lynbrook that his
life there was carried on in the setting of foils and boxing-gloves,
firearms and racing-trophies, which had expressed
Dick Westmore's ideals. Never very keenly
alive to his material surroundings, and quite unconscious
of the irony of this proximity, Amherst had come
to accept his wife's guests as unquestioningly as their
background, and with the same sense of their being an
inevitable part of his new life. Their talk was no more
intelligible to him than the red and yellow hieroglyphics
of the racing-prints, and he smoked in silence while Mr.
Langhope discoursed to Westy Gaines on the recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[p 276]</a></span>
sale of Chinese porcelains at which he had been lucky
enough to pick up the set of Ming for his daughter, and
Mason Winch expounded to a group of languid listeners
the essential dependence of the labouring-man
on the prosperity of Wall Street. In a retired corner,
Ned Bowfort was imparting facts of a more personal
nature to a chosen following who hailed with suppressed
enjoyment the murmured mention of proper
names; and now and then Amherst found himself
obliged to say to Fenton Carbury, who with one accord
had been left on his hands, "Yes, I understand the
flat-tread tire is best," or, "There's a good deal to be
said for the low tension magneto&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But all the while his conscious thoughts were absorbed
in the remembrance of his talk with Justine
Brent. He had left his wife's presence in that state of
moral lassitude when the strongest hopes droop under
the infection of indifference and hostility, and the effort
of attainment seems out of all proportion to the end
in view; but as he listened to Justine all his energies
sprang to life again. Here at last was some one who
felt the urgency of his task: her every word and look
confirmed her comment of the afternoon: "Westmore
must be foremost to you both in time&mdash;I don't
see how either of you can escape it."</p>

<p>She saw it, as he did, to be the special outlet offered
for the expression of what he was worth to the world;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[p 277]</a></span>
and with the knowledge that one other person recognized
his call, it sounded again loudly in his heart. Yes,
he would go on, patiently and persistently, conquering
obstacles, suffering delay, enduring criticism&mdash;hardest
of all, bearing with his wife's deepening indifference and
distrust. Justine had said "Westmore must be foremost
to you both," and he would prove that she was
right&mdash;spite of the powers leagued against him he would
win over Bessy in the end!</p>

<p>Those observers who had been struck by the length
and animation of Miss Brent's talk with her host&mdash;and
among whom Mrs. Ansell and Westy Gaines were foremost&mdash;would
hardly have believed how small a part
her personal charms had played in attracting him.
Amherst was still under the power of the other kind of
beauty&mdash;the soft graces personifying the first triumph
of sex in his heart&mdash;and Justine's dark slenderness
could not at once dispel the milder image. He watched
her with pleasure while she talked, but her face interested
him only as the vehicle of her ideas&mdash;she looked
as a girl must look who felt and thought as she did.
He was aware that everything about her was quick and
fine and supple, and that the muscles of character lay
close to the surface of feeling; but the interpenetration
of spirit and flesh that made her body seem like the
bright projection of her mind left him unconscious
of anything but the oneness of their thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[p 278]</a></span></p>

<p>So these two, in their hour of doubt, poured strength
into each other's hearts, each unconscious of what they
gave, and of its hidden power of renewing their own
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Mr. Langhope had ever stooped to such facile
triumphs as that summed up in the convenient
"I told you so," he would have loosed the phrase on
Mrs. Ansell in the course of a colloquy which these two,
the next afternoon, were at some pains to defend from
the incursions of the Lynbrook house-party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell was the kind of woman who could encircle
herself with privacy on an excursion-boat and
create a nook in an hotel drawing-room, but it taxed
even her ingenuity to segregate herself from the Telfers.
When the feat was accomplished, and it became evident
that Mr. Langhope could yield himself securely to the
joys of confidential discourse, he paused on the brink
of disclosure to say: "It's as well I saved that Ming
from the ruins."</p>

<p>"What ruins?" she exclaimed, her startled look giving
him the full benefit of the effect he was seeking to
produce.</p>

<p>He addressed himself deliberately to the selecting
and lighting of a cigarette. "Truscomb is down and
out&mdash;resigned, 'the wise it call.' And the alterations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[p 279]</a></span>
at Westmore are going to cost a great deal more than
my experienced son-in-law expected. This is Westy's
morning budget&mdash;he and Amherst had it out last night.
I tell my poor girl that at least she'll lose nothing when
the <i>bibelots</i> I've bought for her go up the spout."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell received this with a troubled countenance.
"What has become of Bessy? I've not seen
her since luncheon."</p>

<p>"No. She and Blanche Carbury have motored over
to dine with the Nick Ledgers at Islip."</p>

<p>"Did you see her before she left?"</p>

<p>"For a moment, but she said very little. Westy tells
me that Amherst hints at leasing the New York house.
One can understand that she's left speechless."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, at this, sat bolt upright. "The New
York house?" But she broke off to add, with seeming
irrelevance: "If you knew how I detest Blanche Carbury!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope made a gesture of semi-acquiescence.
"She is not the friend I should have chosen for Bessy&mdash;but
we know that Providence makes use of strange
instruments."</p>

<p>"Providence and Blanche Carbury?" She stared at
him. "Ah, you are profoundly corrupt!"</p>

<p>"I have the coarse masculine habit of looking facts
in the face. Woman-like, you prefer to make use of
them privately, and cut them when you meet in public."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[p 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blanche is not the kind of fact I should care to
make use of under any circumstances whatever!"</p>

<p>"No one asks you to. Simply regard her as a force of
nature&mdash;let her alone, and don't put up too many
lightning-rods."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his face. "Do you really
mean that you want Bessy to get a divorce?"</p>

<p>"Your style is elliptical, dear Maria; but divorce
does not frighten me very much. It has grown almost
as painless as modern dentistry."</p>

<p>"It's our odious insensibility that makes it so!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope received this with the mildness of suspended
judgment. "How else, then, do you propose
that Bessy shall save what is left of her money?"</p>

<p>"I would rather see her save what is left of her
happiness. Bessy will never be happy in the new
way."</p>

<p>"What do you call the new way?"</p>

<p>"Launching one's boat over a human body&mdash;or several,
as the case may be!"</p>

<p>"But don't you see that, as an expedient to bring this
madman to reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've told you that you don't understand him!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope turned on her with what would have
been a show of temper in any one less provided with
shades of manner. "Well, then, explain him, for God's
sake!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[p 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might explain him by saying that she's still in love
with him."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you're still imprisoned in the old formulas!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell confronted him with a grave face. "Isn't
that precisely what Bessy is? Isn't she one of the most
harrowing victims of the plan of bringing up our girls
in the double bondage of expediency and unreality,
corrupting their bodies with luxury and their brains
with sentiment, and leaving them to reconcile the two
as best they can, or lose their souls in the attempt?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope smiled. "I may observe that, with
my poor child so early left alone to me, I supposed I
was doing my best in committing her guidance to some
of the most admirable women I know."</p>

<p>"Of whom I was one&mdash;and not the least lamentable
example of the system! Of course the only thing that
saves us from their vengeance," Mrs. Ansell added,
"is that so few of them ever stop to think...."</p>

<p>"And yet, as I make out, it's precisely what you
would have Bessy do!"</p>

<p>"It's what neither you nor I can help her doing.
You've given her just acuteness enough to question,
without consecutiveness enough to explain. But if she
must perish in the struggle&mdash;and I see no hope for
her&mdash;" cried Mrs. Ansell, starting suddenly and dramatically
to her feet, "at least let her perish defending
her ideals and not denying them&mdash;even if she has to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[p 282]</a></span>
sell the New York house and all your china pots into
the bargain!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope, rising also, deprecatingly lifted his
hands, "If that's what you call saving me from her
vengeance&mdash;sending the crockery crashing round my
ears!" And, as she turned away without any pretense
of capping his pleasantry, he added, with a gleam of
friendly malice: "I suppose you're going to the Hunt
ball as Cassandra?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Amherst, that morning, had sought out his wife with the
definite resolve to efface the unhappy impression of their
previous talk. He blamed himself for having been too
easily repelled by her impatience. As the stronger of the
two, with the power of a fixed purpose to sustain him, he
should have allowed for the instability of her impulses,
and above all for the automatic influences of habit.</p>

<p>Knowing that she did not keep early hours he delayed
till ten o'clock to present himself at her sitting-room
door, but the maid who answered his knock informed
him that Mrs. Amherst was not yet up.</p>

<p>His reply that he would wait did not appear to hasten
the leisurely process of her toilet, and he had the room
to himself for a full half-hour. Many months had
passed since he had spent so long a time in it, and
though habitually unobservant of external details, he
now found an outlet for his restlessness in mechanically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[p 283]</a></span>
noting the intimate appurtenances of Bessy's life. He
was at first merely conscious of a soothing harmony of
line and colour, extending from the blurred tints of the
rug to the subdued gleam of light on old picture-frames
and on the slender flanks of porcelain vases; but gradually
he began to notice how every chair and screen and
cushion, and even every trifling utensil on the inlaid
writing-desk, had been chosen with reference to the
whole composition, and to the minutest requirements
of a fastidious leisure. A few months ago this studied
setting, if he had thought of it at all, would have justified
itself as expressing the pretty woman's natural
affinity with pretty toys; but now it was the cost of it
that struck him. He was beginning to learn from
Bessy's bills that no commodity is taxed as high as
beauty, and the beauty about him filled him with sudden
repugnance, as the disguise of the evil influences
that were separating his wife's life from his.</p>

<p>But with her entrance he dismissed the thought, and
tried to meet her as if nothing stood in the way of their
full communion. Her hair, still wet from the bath,
broke from its dryad-like knot in dusky rings and
spirals threaded with gold, and from her loose flexible
draperies, and her whole person as she moved, there
came a scent of youth and morning freshness. Her
beauty touched him, and made it easier for him to
humble himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[p 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was stupid and disagreeable last night. I can
never say what I want when I have to count the minutes,
and I've come back now for a quiet talk," he
began.</p>

<p>A shade of distrust passed over Bessy's face. "About
business?" she asked, pausing a few feet away from him.</p>

<p>"Don't let us give it that name!" He went up to
her and drew her two hands into his. "You used to
call it our work&mdash;won't you go back to that way of
looking at it?"</p>

<p>Her hands resisted his pressure. "I didn't know,
then, that it was going to be the only thing you cared
for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But for her own sake he would not let her go on.
"Some day I shall make you see how much my caring
for it means my caring for you. But meanwhile," he
urged, "won't you overcome your aversion to the subject,
and bear with it as my work, if you no longer care
to think of it as yours?"</p>

<p>Bessy, freeing herself, sat down on the edge of the
straight-backed chair near the desk, as though to mark
the parenthetical nature of the interview.</p>

<p>"I know you think me stupid&mdash;but wives are not
usually expected to go into all the details of their husband's
business. I have told you to do whatever you
wish at Westmore, and I can't see why that is not
enough."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[p 285]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst looked at her in surprise. Something in
her quick mechanical utterance suggested that not only
the thought but the actual words she spoke had been
inspired, and he fancied he heard in them an echo of
Blanche Carbury's tones. Though Bessy's intimacy
with Mrs. Carbury was of such recent date, fragments
of unheeded smoking-room gossip now recurred to confirm
the vague antipathy which Amherst had felt for
her the previous evening.</p>

<p>"I know that, among your friends, wives are not
expected to interest themselves in their husbands' work,
and if the mills were mine I should try to conform to
the custom, though I should always think it a pity that
the questions that fill a man's thoughts should be ruled
out of his talk with his wife; but as it is, I am only
your representative at Westmore, and I don't see how
we can help having the subject come up between us."</p>

<p>Bessy remained silent, not as if acquiescing in his
plea, but as though her own small stock of arguments
had temporarily failed her; and he went on, enlarging
on his theme with a careful avoidance of technical
terms, and with the constant effort to keep the human
and personal side of the question before her.</p>

<p>She listened without comment, her eyes fixed on a
little jewelled letter-opener which she had picked up
from the writing-table, and which she continued to
turn in her fingers while he spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[p 286]</a></span></p>

<p>The full development of Amherst's plans at Westmore,
besides resulting, as he had foreseen, in Truscomb's
resignation, and in Halford Gaines's outspoken
resistance to the new policy, had necessitated a larger
immediate outlay of capital than the first estimates
demanded, and Amherst, in putting his case to Bessy,
was prepared to have her meet it on the old ground
of the disapproval of all her advisers. But when
he had ended she merely said, without looking up
from the toy in her hand: "I always expected that
you would need a great deal more money than you
thought."</p>

<p>The comment touched him at his most vulnerable
point. "But you see why? You understand how the
work has gone on growing&mdash;?"</p>

<p>His wife lifted her head to glance at him for a moment.
"I am not sure that I understand," she said
indifferently; "but if another loan is necessary, of
course I will sign the note for it."</p>

<p>The words checked his reply by bringing up, before
he was prepared to deal with it, the other and more
embarrassing aspect of the question. He had hoped
to reawaken in Bessy some feeling for the urgency of
his task before having to take up the subject of its
cost; but her cold anticipation of his demands as part
of a disagreeable business to be despatched and put
out of mind, doubled the difficulty of what he had left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[p 287]</a></span>
to say; and it occurred to him that she had perhaps
foreseen and reckoned on this result.</p>

<p>He met her eyes gravely. "Another loan <i>is</i> necessary;
but if any proper provision is to be made for
paying it back, your expenses will have to be cut down
a good deal for the next few months."</p>

<p>The blood leapt to Bessy's face. "My expenses?
You seem to forget how much I've had to cut them
down already."</p>

<p>"The household bills certainly don't show it. They
are increasing steadily, and there have been some very
heavy incidental payments lately."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by incidental payments?"</p>

<p>"Well, there was the pair of cobs you bought last
month&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She returned to a resigned contemplation of the letter-opener.
"With only one motor, one must have more
horses, of course."</p>

<p>"The stables seemed to me fairly full before. But
if you required more horses, I don't see why, at this
particular moment, it was also necessary to buy a set of
Chinese vases for twenty-five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Bessy, at this, lifted her head with an air of decision
that surprised him. Her blush had faded as quickly
as it came, and he noticed that she was pale to the lips.</p>

<p>"I know you don't care about such things; but I
had an exceptional chance of securing the vases at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[p 288]</a></span>
low price&mdash;they are really worth twice as much&mdash;and
Dick always wanted a set of Ming for the drawing-room
mantelpiece."</p>

<p>Richard Westmore's name was always tacitly avoided
between them, for in Amherst's case the disagreeable
sense of dependence on a dead man's bounty increased
that feeling of obscure constraint and repugnance which
any reminder of the first husband's existence is wont
to produce in his successor.</p>

<p>He reddened at the reply, and Bessy, profiting by an
embarrassment which she had perhaps consciously
provoked, went on hastily, and as if by rote: "I have
left you perfectly free to do as you think best at the
mills, but this perpetual discussion of my personal expenses
is very unpleasant to me, as I am sure it must be
to you, and in future I think it would be much better
for us to have separate accounts."</p>

<p>"Separate accounts?" Amherst echoed in genuine
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I should like my personal expenses to be under my
own control again&mdash;I have never been used to accounting
for every penny I spend."</p>

<p>The vertical lines deepened between Amherst's brows.
"You are of course free to spend your money as you
like&mdash;and I thought you were doing so when you authorized
me, last spring, to begin the changes at Westmore."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[p 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Her lip trembled. "Do you reproach me for that?
I didn't understand...you took advantage...."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>At his tone the blood rushed back to her face. "It
was my fault, of course&mdash;I only wanted to please
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amherst was silent, confronted by the sudden sense
of his own responsibility. What she said was true&mdash;he
had known, when he exacted the sacrifice, that she
made it only to please him, on an impulse of reawakened
feeling, and not from any real recognition of a larger
duty. The perception of this made him answer gently:
"I am willing to take any blame you think I deserve; but
it won't help us now to go back to the past. It is more
important that we should come to an understanding
about the future. If by keeping your personal account
separate, you mean that you wish to resume control of
your whole income, then you ought to understand that
the improvements at the mills will have to be dropped
at once, and things there go back to their old state."</p>

<p>She started up with an impatient gesture. "Oh, I
should like never to hear of the mills again!"</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment in silence. "Am I to
take that as your answer?"</p>

<p>She walked toward her door without returning his
look. "Of course," she murmured, "you will end by
doing as you please."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[p 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The retort moved him, for he heard in it the cry of
her wounded pride. He longed to be able to cry out
in return that Westmore was nothing to him, that
all he asked was to see her happy.... But it was
not true, and his manhood revolted from the deception.
Besides, its effect would be only temporary&mdash;would
wear no better than her vain efforts to simulate
an interest in his work. Between them, forever, were
the insurmountable barriers of character, of education,
of habit&mdash;and yet it was not in him to believe that any
barrier was insurmountable.</p>

<p>"Bessy," he exclaimed, following her, "don't let us
part in this way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused with her hand on her dressing-room door.
"It is time to dress for church," she objected, turning
to glance at the little gilt clock on the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>"For church?" Amherst stared, wondering that at
such a crisis she should have remained detached enough
to take note of the hour.</p>

<p>"You forget," she replied, with an air of gentle reproof,
"that before we married I was in the habit of
going to church every Sunday."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to be sure. Would you not like me to go
with you?" he rejoined gently, as if roused to the consciousness
of another omission in the long list of his
social shortcomings; for church-going, at Lynbrook,
had always struck him as a purely social observance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[p 291]</a></span></p>

<p>But Bessy had opened the door of her dressing-room.
"I much prefer that you should do what you like," she
said as she passed from the room.</p>

<p>Amherst made no farther attempt to detain her, and
the door closed on her as though it were closing on a
chapter in their lives.</p>

<p>"That's the end of it!" he murmured, picking up the
letter-opener she had been playing with, and twirling
it absently in his fingers. But nothing in life ever ends,
and the next moment a new question confronted him&mdash;how
was the next chapter to open?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[p 292]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in October when Amherst returned to
Lynbrook.</p>

<p>He had begun to learn, in the interval, the lesson
most difficult to his direct and trenchant nature: that
compromise is the law of married life. On the afternoon
of his talk with his wife he had sought her out,
determined to make a final effort to clear up the situation
between them; but he learned that, immediately
after luncheon, she had gone off in the motor with Mrs.
Carbury and two men of the party, leaving word that
they would probably not be back till evening. It cost
Amherst a struggle, when he had humbled himself to
receive this information from the butler, not to pack
his portmanteau and take the first train for Hanaford;
but he was still under the influence of Justine Brent's
words, and also of his own feeling that, at this juncture,
a break between himself and Bessy would be final.</p>

<p>He stayed on accordingly, enduring as best he might
the mute observation of the household, and the gentle
irony of Mr. Langhope's attentions; and before he left
Lynbrook, two days later, a provisional understanding
had been reached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[p 293]</a></span></p>

<p>His wife proved more firm than he had foreseen in
her resolve to regain control of her income, and the
talk between them ended in reciprocal concessions,
Bessy consenting to let the town house for the winter
and remain at Lynbrook, while Amherst agreed to restrict
his improvements at Westmore to such alterations
as had already been begun, and to reduce the
expenditure on these as much as possible. It was virtually
the defeat of his policy, and he had to suffer the
decent triumph of the Gaineses, as well as the bitterer
pang of his foiled aspirations. In spite of the opposition
of the directors, he had taken advantage of Truscomb's
resignation to put Duplain at the head of the
mills; but the new manager's outspoken disgust at the
company's change of plan made it clear that he would
not remain long at Westmore, and it was one of the
miseries of Amherst's situation that he could not give
the reasons for his defection, but must bear to figure in
Duplain's terse vocabulary as a "quitter." The difficulty
of finding a new manager expert enough to satisfy
the directors, yet in sympathy with his own social
theories, made Amherst fear that Duplain's withdrawal
would open the way for Truscomb's reinstatement, an
outcome on which he suspected Halford Gaines had
always counted; and this possibility loomed before him
as the final defeat of his hopes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the issues ahead had at least the merit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[p 294]</a></span>
keeping him busy. The task of modifying and retrenching
his plans contrasted drearily with the hopeful
activity of the past months, but he had an iron capacity
for hard work under adverse conditions, and the fact of
being too busy for thought helped him to wear through
the days. This pressure of work relieved him, at first,
from too close consideration of his relation to Bessy.
He had yielded up his dearest hopes at her wish, and
for the moment his renunciation had set a chasm between
them; but gradually he saw that, as he was
patching together the ruins of his Westmore plans, so
he must presently apply himself to the reconstruction
of his married life.</p>

<p>Before leaving Lynbrook he had had a last word with
Miss Brent; not a word of confidence&mdash;for the same
sense of reserve kept both from any explicit renewal of
their moment's intimacy&mdash;but one of those exchanges
of commonplace phrase that circumstances may be
left to charge with special meaning. Justine had
merely asked if he were really leaving and, on his assenting,
had exclaimed quickly: "But you will come
back soon?"</p>

<p>"I shall certainly come back," he answered; and
after a pause he added: "I shall find you here? You
will remain at Lynbrook?"</p>

<p>On her part also there was a shade of hesitation;
then she said with a smile: "Yes, I shall stay."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[p 295]</a></span></p>

<p>His look brightened. "And you'll write me if anything&mdash;if
Bessy should not be well?"</p>

<p>"I will write you," she promised; and a few weeks
after his return to Hanaford he had, in fact, received
a short note from her. Its ostensible purpose was to
reassure him as to Bessy's health, which had certainly
grown stronger since Dr. Wyant had persuaded her,
at the close of the last house-party, to accord herself a
period of quiet; but (the writer added) now that Mr.
Langhope and Mrs. Ansell had also left, the quiet was
perhaps too complete, and Bessy's nerves were beginning
to suffer from the reaction.</p>

<p>Amherst had no difficulty in interpreting this brief
communication. "I have succeeded in dispersing the
people who are always keeping you and your wife
apart; now is your chance: come and take it." That
was what Miss Brent's letter meant; and his answer
was a telegram to Bessy, announcing his return to Long
Island.</p>

<p>The step was not an easy one; but decisive action,
however hard, was always easier to Amherst than the
ensuing interval of readjustment. To come to Lynbrook
had required a strong effort of will; but the
effort of remaining there called into play less disciplined
faculties.</p>

<p>Amherst had always been used to doing things; now
he had to resign himself to enduring a state of things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[p 296]</a></span>
The material facilities of the life about him, the way in
which the machinery of the great empty house ran on
like some complex apparatus working in the void, increased
the exasperation of his nerves. Dr. Wyant's
suggestion&mdash;which Amherst suspected Justine of having
prompted&mdash;that Mrs. Amherst should cancel her autumn
engagements, and give herself up to a quiet outdoor
life with her husband, seemed to present the very
opportunity these two distracted spirits needed to find
and repossess each other. But, though Amherst was
grateful to Bessy for having dismissed her visitors&mdash;partly
to please him, as he guessed&mdash;yet he found the
routine of the establishment more oppressive than when
the house was full. If he could have been alone with
her in a quiet corner&mdash;the despised cottage at Westmore,
even!&mdash;he fancied they might still have been
brought together by restricted space and the familiar
exigencies of life. All the primitive necessities which
bind together, through their recurring daily wants, natures
fated to find no higher point of union, had been
carefully eliminated from the life at Lynbrook, where
material needs were not only provided for but anticipated
by a hidden mechanism that filled the house with
the perpetual sense of invisible attendance. Though
Amherst knew that he and Bessy could never meet in
the region of great issues, he thought he might have
regained the way to her heart, and found relief from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[p 297]</a></span>
his own inaction, in the small ministrations of daily
life; but the next moment he smiled to picture Bessy
in surroundings where the clocks were not wound of
themselves and the doors did not fly open at her approach.
Those thick-crowding cares and drudgeries
which serve as merciful screens between so many discordant
natures would have been as intolerable to her
as was to Amherst the great glare of leisure in which
he and she were now confronted.</p>

<p>He saw that Bessy was in the state of propitiatory
eagerness which always followed on her gaining a point
in their long duel; and he could guess that she was
tremulously anxious not only to make up to him, by
all the arts she knew, for the sacrifice she had exacted,
but also to conceal from every one the fact that, as Mr.
Langhope bluntly put it, he had been "brought to
terms." Amherst was touched by her efforts, and
half-ashamed of his own inability to respond to them.
But his mind, released from its normal preoccupations,
had become a dangerous instrument of analysis and
disintegration, and conditions which, a few months
before, he might have accepted with the wholesome
tolerance of the busy man, now pressed on him unendurably.
He saw that he and his wife were really
face to face for the first time since their marriage.
Hitherto something had always intervened between
them&mdash;first the spell of her grace and beauty, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[p 298]</a></span>
brief joy of her participation in his work; then the
sorrow of their child's death, and after that the temporary
exhilaration of carrying out his ideas at Westmore&mdash;but
now that the last of these veils had been
torn away they faced each other as strangers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The habit of keeping factory hours always drove Amherst
forth long before his wife's day began, and in the
course of one of his early tramps he met Miss Brent and
Cicely setting out for a distant swamp where rumour
had it that a rare native orchid might be found. Justine's
sylvan tastes had developed in the little girl a
passion for such pillaging expeditions, and Cicely, who
had discovered that her step-father knew almost as
much about birds and squirrels as Miss Brent did
about flowers, was not to be appeased till Amherst
had scrambled into the pony-cart, wedging his long
legs between a fern-box and a lunch-basket, and balancing
a Scotch terrier's telescopic body across his
knees.</p>

<p>The season was so mild that only one or two light
windless frosts had singed the foliage of oaks and
beeches, and gilded the roadsides with a smooth carpeting
of maple leaves. The morning haze rose like
smoke from burnt-out pyres of sumach and sugar-maple;
a silver bloom lay on the furrows of the ploughed
fields; and now and then, as they drove on, the wooded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[p 299]</a></span>
road showed at its end a tarnished disk of light, where
sea and sky were merged.</p>

<p>At length they left the road for a winding track
through scrub-oaks and glossy thickets of mountain-laurel;
the track died out at the foot of a wooded knoll,
and clambering along its base they came upon the
swamp. There it lay in charmed solitude, shut in by
a tawny growth of larch and swamp-maple, its edges
burnt out to smouldering shades of russet, ember-red
and ashen-grey, while the quaking centre still preserved
a jewel-like green, where hidden lanes of moisture
wound between islets tufted with swamp-cranberry
and with the charred browns of fern and wild rose
and bay. Sodden earth and decaying branches gave
forth a strange sweet odour, as of the aromatic essences
embalming a dead summer; and the air charged
with this scent was so still that the snapping of witch-hazel
pods, the drop of a nut, the leap of a startled
frog, pricked the silence with separate points of
sound.</p>

<p>The pony made fast, the terrier released, and fern-box
and lunch-basket slung over Amherst's shoulder,
the three explorers set forth on their journey. Amherst,
as became his sex, went first; but after a few
absent-minded plunges into the sedgy depths between
the islets, he was ordered to relinquish his command
and fall to the rear, where he might perform the hum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[p 300]</a></span>bler
service of occasionally lifting Cicely over unspannable
gulfs of moisture.</p>

<p>Justine, leading the way, guided them across the
treacherous surface as fearlessly as a king-fisher, lighting
instinctively on every grass-tussock and submerged
tree-stump of the uncertain path. Now and then she
paused, her feet drawn close on their narrow perch,
and her slender body swaying over as she reached down
for some rare growth detected among the withered reeds
and grasses; then she would right herself again by a
backward movement as natural as the upward spring
of a branch&mdash;so free and flexible in all her motions that
she seemed akin to the swaying reeds and curving
brambles which caught at her as she passed.</p>

<p>At length the explorers reached the mossy corner
where the orchids grew, and Cicely, securely balanced
on a fallen tree-trunk, was allowed to dig the coveted
roots. When they had been packed away, it was felt
that this culminating moment must be celebrated with
immediate libations of jam and milk; and having
climbed to a dry slope among the pepper-bushes, the
party fell on the contents of the lunch-basket. It was
just the hour when Bessy's maid was carrying her
breakfast-tray, with its delicate service of old silver
and porcelain, into the darkened bed-room at Lynbrook;
but early rising and hard scrambling had
whetted the appetites of the naturalists, and the nurs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[p 301]</a></span>ery
fare which Cicely spread before them seemed a
sumptuous reward for their toil.</p>

<p>"I do like this kind of picnic much better than the
ones where mother takes all the footmen, and the
mayonnaise has to be scraped off things before I can
eat them," Cicely declared, lifting her foaming mouth
from a beaker of milk.</p>

<p>Amherst, lighting his pipe, stretched himself contentedly
among the pepper-bushes, steeped in that unreflecting
peace which is shed into some hearts by
communion with trees and sky. He too was glad to get
away from the footmen and the mayonnaise, and he
imagined that his stepdaughter's exclamation summed
up all the reasons for his happiness. The boyish
wood-craft which he had cultivated in order to encourage
the same taste in his factory lads came to life in
this sudden return to nature, and he redeemed his
clumsiness in crossing the swamp by spying a marsh-wren's
nest that had escaped Justine, and detecting in
a swiftly-flitting olive-brown bird a belated tanager in
autumn incognito.</p>

<p>Cicely sat rapt while he pictured the bird's winter
pilgrimage, with glimpses of the seas and islands that
fled beneath him till his long southern flight ended in
the dim glades of the equatorial forests.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a good life&mdash;how I should like to be a
wander-bird, and look down people's chimneys twice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[p 302]</a></span>
a year!" Justine laughed, tilting her head back to
catch a last glimpse of the tanager.</p>

<p>The sun beamed full on their ledge from a sky of
misty blue, and she had thrown aside her hat, uncovering
her thick waves of hair, blue-black in the hollows,
with warm rusty edges where they took the light. Cicely
dragged down a plumy spray of traveller's joy and
wound it above her friend's forehead; and thus
wreathed, with her bright pallour relieved against the
dusky autumn tints, Justine looked like a wood-spirit
who had absorbed into herself the last golden juices
of the year.</p>

<p>She leaned back laughing against a tree-trunk, pelting
Cicely with witch-hazel pods, making the terrier
waltz for scraps of ginger-bread, and breaking off now
and then to imitate, with her clear full notes, the call
of some hidden marsh-bird, or the scolding chatter of
a squirrel in the scrub-oaks.</p>

<p>"Is that what you'd like most about the journey&mdash;looking
down the chimneys?" Amherst asked with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know&mdash;I should love it all! Think of
the joy of skimming over half the earth&mdash;seeing it born
again out of darkness every morning! Sometimes,
when I've been up all night with a patient, and have
seen the world <i>come back to me</i> like that, I've been
almost mad with its beauty; and then the thought that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[p 303]</a></span>
I've never seen more than a little corner of it makes me
feel as if I were chained. But I think if I had wings I
should choose to be a house-swallow; and then, after
I'd had my fill of wonders, I should come back to my
familiar corner, and my house full of busy humdrum
people, and fly low to warn them of rain, and wheel up
high to show them it was good haying weather, and
know what was going on in every room in the house,
and every house in the village; and all the while I
should be hugging my wonderful big secret&mdash;the secret
of snow-plains and burning deserts, and coral islands
and buried cities&mdash;and should put it all into my chatter
under the eaves, that the people in the house were
always too busy to stop and listen to&mdash;and when winter
came I'm sure I should hate to leave them, even to go
back to my great Brazilian forests full of orchids and
monkeys!"</p>

<p>"But, Justine, in winter you could take care of the
monkeys," the practical Cicely suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and that would remind me of home!" Justine
cried, swinging about to pinch the little girl's chin.</p>

<p>She was in one of the buoyant moods when the spirit
of life caught her in its grip, and shook and tossed her
on its mighty waves as a sea-bird is tossed through the
spray of flying rollers. At such moments all the light
and music of the world seemed distilled into her veins,
and forced up in bubbles of laughter to her lips and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[p 304]</a></span>
eyes. Amherst had never seen her thus, and he watched
her with the sense of relaxation which the contact of
limpid gaiety brings to a mind obscured by failure and
self-distrust. The world was not so dark a place after
all, if such springs of merriment could well up in a
heart as sensitive as hers to the burden and toil of
existence.</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange," she went on with a sudden drop
to gravity, "that the bird whose wings carry him
farthest and show him the most wonderful things, is
the one who always comes back to the eaves, and is
happiest in the thick of everyday life?"</p>

<p>Her eyes met Amherst's. "It seems to me," he
said, "that you're like that yourself&mdash;loving long
flights, yet happiest in the thick of life."</p>

<p>She raised her dark brows laughingly. "So I imagine&mdash;but
then you see I've never had the long
flight!"</p>

<p>Amherst smiled. "Ah, there it is&mdash;one never knows&mdash;one
never says, <i>This is the moment</i>! because, however
good it is, it always seems the door to a better one
beyond. Faust never said it till the end, when he'd
nothing left of all he began by thinking worth while;
and then, with what a difference it was said!"</p>

<p>She pondered. "Yes&mdash;but it <i>was</i> the best, after all&mdash;the
moment in which he had nothing left...."</p>

<p>"Oh," Cicely broke in suddenly, "do look at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[p 305]</a></span>
squirrel up there! See, father&mdash;he's off! Let's follow
him!"</p>

<p>As she crouched there, with head thrown back, and
sparkling lips and eyes, her fair hair&mdash;of her mother's
very hue&mdash;making a shining haze about her face, Amherst
recalled the winter evening at Hopewood, when
he and Bessy had tracked the grey squirrel under the
snowy beeches. Scarcely three years ago&mdash;and how
bitter memory had turned! A chilly cloud spread
over his spirit, reducing everything once more to the
leaden hue of reality....</p>

<p>"It's too late for any more adventures&mdash;we must be
going," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amherst's</span> morning excursions with his step-daughter
and Miss Brent renewed themselves
more than once. He welcomed any pretext for escaping
from the unprofitable round of his thoughts, and
these woodland explorations, with their gay rivalry of
search for some rare plant or elusive bird, and the
contact with the child's happy wonder, and with the
morning brightness of Justine's mood, gave him his
only moments of self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p>But the first time that Cicely's chatter carried home
an echo of their adventures, Amherst saw a cloud on
his wife's face. Her resentment of Justine's influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[p 306]</a></span>
over the child had long since subsided, and in the
temporary absence of the governess she was glad to
have Cicely amused; but she was never quite satisfied
that those about her should have pursuits and diversions
in which she did not share. Her jealousy did
not concentrate itself on her husband and Miss Brent:
Amherst had never shown any inclination for the
society of other women, and if the possibility had
been suggested to her, she would probably have said
that Justine was not "in his style"&mdash;so unconscious is
a pretty woman apt to be of the versatility of masculine
tastes. But Amherst saw that she felt herself excluded
from amusements in which she had no desire to join,
and of which she consequently failed to see the
purpose; and he gave up accompanying his stepdaughter.</p>

<p>Bessy, as if in acknowledgment of his renunciation,
rose earlier in order to prolong their rides together.
Dr. Wyant had counselled her against the fatigue of
following the hounds, and she instinctively turned their
horses away from the course the hunt was likely to
take; but now and then the cry of the pack, or the
flash of red on a distant slope, sent the blood to her
face and made her press her mare to a gallop. When
they escaped such encounters she showed no great zest
in the exercise, and their rides resolved themselves into
a spiritless middle-aged jog along the autumn lanes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[p 307]</a></span>
In the early days of their marriage the joy of a canter
side by side had merged them in a community of sensation
beyond need of speech; but now that the physical
spell had passed they felt the burden of a silence that
neither knew how to break.</p>

<p>Once only, a moment's friction galvanized these lifeless
rides. It was one morning when Bessy's wild mare
Impulse, under-exercised and over-fed, suddenly broke
from her control, and would have unseated her but for
Amherst's grasp on the bridle.</p>

<p>"The horse is not fit for you to ride," he exclaimed,
as the hot creature, with shudders of defiance rippling
her flanks, lapsed into sullen subjection.</p>

<p>"It's only because I don't ride her enough," Bessy
panted. "That new groom is ruining her mouth."</p>

<p>"You must not ride her alone, then."</p>

<p>"I shall not let that man ride her."</p>

<p>"I say you must not ride her alone."</p>

<p>"It's ridiculous to have a groom at one's heels!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you must, if you ride Impulse."</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and she quivered and yielded like the
horse. "Oh, if you say so&mdash;" She always hugged his
brief flashes of authority.</p>

<p>"I do say so. You promise me?"</p>

<p>"If you like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Amherst had made an attempt to occupy himself with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[p 308]</a></span>
the condition of Lynbrook, one of those slovenly villages,
without individual character or the tradition of
self-respect, which spring up in America on the skirts
of the rich summer colonies. But Bessy had never
given Lynbrook a thought, and he realized the futility
of hoping to interest her in its mongrel population of
day-labourers and publicans so soon after his glaring
failure at Westmore. The sight of the village irritated
him whenever he passed through the Lynbrook gates,
but having perforce accepted the situation of prince
consort, without voice in the government, he tried to
put himself out of relation with all the questions which
had hitherto engrossed him, and to see life simply as a
spectator. He could even conceive that, under certain
conditions, there might be compensations in the passive
attitude; but unfortunately these conditions were not
such as the life at Lynbrook presented.</p>

<p>The temporary cessation of Bessy's week-end parties
had naturally not closed her doors to occasional visitors,
and glimpses of the autumnal animation of Long Island
passed now and then across the Amhersts' horizon.
Blanche Carbury had installed herself at Mapleside, a
fashionable colony half-way between Lynbrook and
Clifton, and even Amherst, unused as he was to noting
the seemingly inconsecutive movements of idle people,
could not but remark that her visits to his wife almost
invariably coincided with Ned Bowfort's cantering over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[p 309]</a></span>
unannounced from the Hunt Club, where he had taken
up his autumn quarters.</p>

<p>There was something very likeable about Bowfort, to
whom Amherst was attracted by the fact that he was
one of the few men of Bessy's circle who knew what
was going on in the outer world. Throughout an existence
which one divined to have been both dependent
and desultory, he had preserved a sense of wider relations
and acquired a smattering of information to which
he applied his only independent faculty, that of clear
thought. He could talk intelligently and not too inaccurately
of the larger questions which Lynbrook
ignored, and a gay indifference to the importance of
money seemed the crowning grace of his nature, till
Amherst suddenly learned that this attitude of detachment
was generally ascribed to the liberality of Mrs.
Fenton Carbury. "Everybody knows she married Fenton
to provide for Ned," some one let fall in the course
of one of the smoking-room dissertations on which the
host of Lynbrook had such difficulty in fixing his attention;
and the speaker's matter-of-course tone, and the
careless acquiescence of his hearers, were more offensive
to Amherst than the fact itself. In the first flush
of his disgust he classed the story as one of the lies bred
in the malarious air of after-dinner gossip; but gradually
he saw that, whether true or not, it had sufficient
circulation to cast a shade of ambiguity on the persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[p 310]</a></span>
concerned. Bessy alone seemed deaf to the rumours
about her friend. There was something captivating
to her in Mrs. Carbury's slang and noise, in her defiance
of decorum and contempt of criticism. "I like
Blanche because she doesn't pretend," was Bessy's
vague justification of the lady; but in reality she was
under the mysterious spell which such natures cast
over the less venturesome imaginations of their own
sex.</p>

<p>Amherst at first tried to deaden himself to the situation,
as part of the larger coil of miseries in which he
found himself; but all his traditions were against such
tolerance, and they were roused to revolt by the receipt
of a newspaper clipping, sent by an anonymous hand,
enlarging on the fact that the clandestine meetings of a
fashionable couple were being facilitated by the connivance
of a Long Island <i>ch&acirc;telaine</i>. Amherst, hot
from the perusal of this paragraph, sprang into the
first train, and laid the clipping before his father-in-law,
who chanced to be passing through town on his
way from the Hudson to the Hot Springs.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope, ensconced in the cushioned privacy
of the reading-room at the Amsterdam Club, where he
had invited his son-in-law to meet him, perused the
article with the cool eye of the collector to whom a new
curiosity is offered.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he mused, "that in the time of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[p 311]</a></span>
Pharaohs the Morning Papyrus used to serve up this
kind of thing"&mdash;and then, as the nervous tension of his
hearer expressed itself in an abrupt movement, he added,
handing back the clipping with a smile: "What do you propose
to do? Kill the editor, and forbid Blanche
and Bowfort the house?"</p>

<p>"I mean to do something," Amherst began, suddenly
chilled by the realization that his wrath had not yet
shaped itself into a definite plan of action.</p>

<p>"Well, it must be that or nothing," said Mr. Langhope,
drawing his stick meditatively across his knee.
"And, of course, if it's <i>that</i>, you'll land Bessy in a devil
of a mess."</p>

<p>Without giving his son-in-law time to protest, he
touched rapidly but vividly on the inutility and embarrassment
of libel suits, and on the devices whereby the
legal means of vindication from such attacks may be
turned against those who have recourse to them; and
Amherst listened with a sickened sense of the incompatibility
between abstract standards of honour and
their practical application.</p>

<p>"What should you do, then?" he murmured, as Mr.
Langhope ended with his light shrug and a "See Tredegar,
if you don't believe me"&mdash;; and his father-in-law
replied with an evasive gesture: "Why, leave the responsibility
where it belongs!"</p>

<p>"Where it belongs?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[p 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"To Fenton Carbury, of course. Luckily it's nobody's
business but his, and if he doesn't mind what is
said about his wife I don't see how you can take up
the cudgels for her without casting another shade on
her somewhat chequered reputation."</p>

<p>Amherst stared. "His wife? What do I care what's
said of her? I'm thinking of mine!"</p>

<p>"Well, if Carbury has no objection to his wife's meeting
Bowfort, I don't see how you can object to her
meeting him at your house. In such matters, as you
know, it has mercifully been decided that the husband's
attitude shall determine other people's; otherwise we
should be deprived of the legitimate pleasure of slandering
our neighbours." Mr. Langhope was always careful
to temper his explanations with an "as you know":
he would have thought it ill-bred to omit this parenthesis
in elucidating the social code to his son-in-law.</p>

<p>"Then you mean that I can do nothing?" Amherst
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope smiled. "What applies to Carbury
applies to you&mdash;by doing nothing you establish the fact
that there's nothing to do; just as you create the difficulty
by recognizing it." And he added, as Amherst
sat silent: "Take Bessy away, and they'll have to see
each other elsewhere."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Amherst returned to Lynbrook with the echoes of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[p 313]</a></span>
casuistry in his brain. It seemed to him but a part of
the ingenious system of evasion whereby a society bent
on the undisturbed pursuit of amusement had contrived
to protect itself from the intrusion of the disagreeable:
a policy summed up in Mr. Langhope's concluding
advice that Amherst should take his wife away.
Yes&mdash;that was wealth's contemptuous answer to every
challenge of responsibility: duty, sorrow and disgrace
were equally to be evaded by a change of residence, and
nothing in life need be faced and fought out while one
could pay for a passage to Europe!</p>

<p>In a calmer mood Amherst's sense of humour would
have preserved him from such a view of his father-in-law's
advice; but just then it fell like a spark on his
smouldering prejudices. He was clear-sighted enough
to recognize the obstacles to legal retaliation; but this
only made him the more resolved to assert his will in
his own house. He no longer paused to consider the
possible effect of such a course on his already strained
relations with his wife: the man's will rose in him and
spoke.</p>

<p>The scene between Bessy and himself was short and
sharp; and it ended in a way that left him more than
ever perplexed at the ways of her sex. Impatient of
preamble, he had opened the attack with his ultimatum:
the suspected couple were to be denied the house.
Bessy flamed into immediate defence of her friend;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[p 314]</a></span>
but to Amherst's surprise she no longer sounded the
note of her own rights. Husband and wife were animated
by emotions deeper-seated and more instinctive
than had ever before confronted them; yet while Amherst's
resistance was gathering strength from the conflict,
Bessy unexpectedly collapsed in tears and submission.
She would do as he wished, of course&mdash;give up
seeing Blanche, dismiss Bowfort, wash her hands, in
short, of the imprudent pair&mdash;in such matters a woman
needed a man's guidance, a wife must of necessity see
with her husband's eyes; and she looked up into his
through a mist of penitence and admiration....</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first reaction from her brief delusion about
Stephen Wyant, Justine accepted with a good
grace the necessity of staying on at Lynbrook. Though
she was now well enough to return to her regular work,
her talk with Amherst had made her feel that, for the
present, she could be of more use by remaining with
Bessy; and she was not sorry to have a farther period
of delay and reflection before taking the next step in
her life. These at least were the reasons she gave herself
for deciding not to leave; and if any less ostensible
lurked beneath, they were not as yet visible even to her
searching self-scrutiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[p 315]</a></span></p>

<p>At first she was embarrassed by the obligation of
meeting Dr. Wyant, on whom her definite refusal had
produced an effect for which she could not hold herself
blameless. She had not kept her promise of seeing him
on the day after their encounter at the post-office, but
had written, instead, in terms which obviously made
such a meeting unnecessary. But all her efforts to
soften the abruptness of her answer could not conceal,
from either herself or her suitor, that it was not the one
she had led him to expect; and she foresaw that if she
remained at Lynbrook she could not escape a scene of
recrimination.</p>

<p>When the scene took place, Wyant's part in it went
far toward justifying her decision; yet his vehement
reproaches contained a sufficient core of truth to humble
her pride. It was lucky for her somewhat exaggerated
sense of fairness that he overshot the mark by
charging her with a coquetry of which she knew herself
innocent, and laying on her the responsibility for
any follies to which her rejection might drive him.
Such threats, as a rule, no longer move the feminine
imagination; yet Justine's pity for all forms of weakness
made her recognize, in the very heat of her contempt
for Wyant, that his reproaches were not the mere
cry of wounded vanity but the appeal of a nature conscious
of its lack of recuperative power. It seemed to
her as though she had done him irreparable harm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[p 316]</a></span>
and the feeling might have betrayed her into too great
a show of compassion had she not been restrained by
a salutary fear of the result.</p>

<p>The state of Bessy's nerves necessitated frequent
visits from her physician, but Justine, on these occasions,
could usually shelter herself behind the professional
reserve which kept even Wyant from any open
expression of feeling. One day, however, they chanced
to find themselves alone before Bessy's return from her
ride. The servant had ushered Wyant into the library
where Justine was writing, and when she had replied
to his enquiries about his patient they found themselves
face to face with an awkward period of waiting. Justine
was too proud to cut it short by leaving the room;
but Wyant answered her commonplaces at random,
stirring uneasily to and fro between window and fireside,
and at length halting behind the table at which
she sat.</p>

<p>"May I ask how much longer you mean to stay
here?" he said in a low voice, his eyes darkening under
the sullen jut of the brows.</p>

<p>As she glanced up in surprise she noticed for the first
time an odd contraction of his pupils, and the discovery,
familiar enough in her professional experience, made
her disregard the abruptness of his question and softened
the tone in which she answered. "I hardly know&mdash;I
suppose as long as I am needed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[p 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Wyant laughed. "Needed by whom? By John
Amherst?"</p>

<p>A moment passed before Justine took in the full
significance of the retort; then the blood rushed to her
face. "Yes&mdash;I believe both Mr. and Mrs. Amherst
need me," she answered, keeping her eyes on his; and
Wyant laughed again.</p>

<p>"You didn't think so till Amherst came back from
Hanaford. His return seems to have changed your
plans in several respects."</p>

<p>She looked away from him, for even now his
eyes moved her to pity and self-reproach. "Dr.
Wyant, you are not well; why do you wait to see
Mrs. Amherst?" she said.</p>

<p>He stared at her and then his glance fell. "I'm much
obliged&mdash;I'm as well as usual," he muttered, pushing
the hair from his forehead with a shaking hand; and
at that moment the sound of Bessy's voice gave Justine
a pretext for escape.</p>

<p>In her own room she sank for a moment under a
rush of self-disgust; but it soon receded before the
saner forces of her nature, leaving only a residue of
pity for the poor creature whose secret she had surprised.
She had never before suspected Wyant of
taking a drug, nor did she now suppose that he did
so habitually; but to see him even momentarily under
such an influence explained her instinctive sense of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[p 318]</a></span>
weakness. She felt now that what would have been an
insult on other lips was only a cry of distress from his;
and once more she blamed herself and forgave him.</p>

<p>But if she had been inclined to any morbidness of
self-reproach she would have been saved from it by
other cares. For the moment she was more concerned
with Bessy's fate than with her own&mdash;her poor friend
seemed to have so much more at stake, and so much
less strength to bring to the defence of her happiness.
Justine was always saved from any excess of self-compassion
by the sense, within herself, of abounding
forces of growth and self-renewal, as though from every
lopped aspiration a fresh shoot of energy must spring;
but she felt that Bessy had no such sources of renovation,
and that every disappointment left an arid spot
in her soul.</p>

<p>Even without her friend's confidences, Justine would
have had no difficulty in following the successive
stages of the Amhersts' inner history. She knew that
Amherst had virtually resigned his rule at Westmore,
and that his wife, in return for the sacrifice, was trying
to conform to the way of life she thought he preferred;
and the futility of both attempts was more visible to
Justine than to either of the two concerned. She saw
that the failure of the Amhersts' marriage lay not in
any accident of outward circumstances but in the lack
of all natural points of contact. As she put it to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[p 319]</a></span>self,
they met neither underfoot nor overhead: practical
necessities united them no more than imaginative
joys.</p>

<p>There were moments when Justine thought Amherst
hard to Bessy, as she suspected that he had once been
hard to his mother&mdash;as the leader of men must perhaps
always be hard to the hampering sex. Yet she
did justice to his efforts to accept the irretrievable,
and to waken in his wife some capacity for sharing in
his minor interests, since she had none of her own
with which to fill their days.</p>

<p>Amherst had always been a reader; not, like Justine
herself, a flame-like devourer of the page, but a slow
absorber of its essence; and in the early days of his
marriage he had fancied it would be easy to make
Bessy share this taste. Though his mother was not a
bookish woman, he had breathed at her side an air rich
in allusion and filled with the bright presences of romance;
and he had always regarded this commerce of
the imagination as one of the normal conditions of life.
The discovery that there were no books at Lynbrook
save a few morocco "sets" imprisoned behind the brass
trellisings of the library had been one of the many surprises
of his new state. But in his first months with
Bessy there was no room for books, and if he thought
of the matter it was only in a glancing vision of future
evenings, when he and she, in the calm afterglow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[p 320]</a></span>
happiness, should lean together over some cherished
page. Her lack of response to any reference outside
the small circle of daily facts had long since dispelled
that vision; but now that his own mind felt the need
of inner sustenance he began to ask himself whether he
might not have done more to rouse her imagination.
During the long evenings over the library fire he tried
to lead the talk to books, with a parenthesis, now and
again, from the page beneath his eye; and Bessy met
the experiment with conciliatory eagerness. She showed,
in especial, a hopeful but misleading preference for
poetry, leaning back with dreaming lids and lovely
parted lips while he rolled out the immortal measures;
but her outward signs of attention never ripened into
any expression of opinion, or any after-allusion to what
she heard, and before long he discovered that Justine
Brent was his only listener. It was to her that the
words he read began to be unconsciously addressed;
her comments directed him in his choice of subjects,
and the ensuing discussions restored him to some
semblance of mental activity.</p>

<p>Bessy, true to her new r&ocirc;le of acquiescence, shone
silently on this interchange of ideas; Amherst even detected
in her a vague admiration for his power of conversing
on subjects which she regarded as abstruse;
and this childlike approval, combined with her submission
to his will, deluded him with a sense of recovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[p 321]</a></span>
power over her. He could not but note that the new
phase in their relations had coincided with his first
assertion of mastery; and he rashly concluded that,
with the removal of the influences tending to separate
them, his wife might gradually be won back to her
earlier sympathy with his views.</p>

<p>To accept this theory was to apply it; for nothing
could long divert Amherst from his main purpose, and
all the thwarted strength of his will was only gathering
to itself fresh stores of energy. He had never been a
skilful lover, for no woman had as yet stirred in him
those feelings which call the finer perceptions into
play; and there was no instinct to tell him that Bessy's
sudden conformity to his wishes was as unreasoning as
her surrender to his first kiss. He fancied that he and
she were at length reaching some semblance of that
moral harmony which should grow out of the physical
accord, and that, poor and incomplete as the understanding
was, it must lift and strengthen their relation.</p>

<p>He waited till early winter had brought solitude
to Lynbrook, dispersing the hunting colony to various
points of the compass, and sending Mr. Langhope to
Egypt and the Riviera, while Mrs. Ansell, as usual,
took up her annual tour of a social circuit whose extreme
points were marked by Boston and Baltimore&mdash;and
then he made his final appeal to his wife.</p>

<p>His pretext for speaking was a letter from Duplain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[p 322]</a></span>
definitely announcing his resolve not to remain at Westmore.
A year earlier Amherst, deeply moved by the
letter, would have given it to his wife in the hope of
its producing the same effect on her. He knew better
now&mdash;he had learned her instinct for detecting "business"
under every serious call on her attention. His
only hope, as always, was to reach her through the
personal appeal; and he put before her the fact of
Duplain's withdrawal as the open victory of his antagonists.
But he saw at once that even this could
not infuse new life into the question.</p>

<p>"If I go back he'll stay&mdash;I can hold him, can gain
time till things take a turn," he urged.</p>

<p>"Another? I thought they were definitely settled,"
she objected languidly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they're not; they can't be, on such a basis,"
Amherst broke out with sudden emphasis. He walked
across the room, and came back to her side with a determined
face. "It's a delusion, a deception," he exclaimed,
"to think I can stand by any longer and see
things going to ruin at Westmore! If I've made you
think so, I've unconsciously deceived us both. As long
as you're my wife we've only one honour between us,
and that honour is mine to take care of."</p>

<p>"Honour? What an odd expression!" she said with
a forced laugh, and a little tinge of pink in her cheek.
"You speak as if I had&mdash;had made myself talked about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[p 323]</a></span>
&mdash;when you know I've never even looked at another
man!"</p>

<p>"Another man?" Amherst looked at her in wonder.
"Good God! Can't you conceive of any vow to be
kept between husband and wife but the primitive one
of bodily fidelity? Heaven knows I've never looked at
another woman&mdash;but, by my reading of our compact, I
shouldn't be keeping faith with you if I didn't help you
to keep faith with better things. And you owe me the
same help&mdash;the same chance to rise through you, and
not sink by you&mdash;else we've betrayed each other more
deeply than any adultery could make us!"</p>

<p>She had drawn back, turning pale again, and shrinking
a little at the sound of words which, except when
heard in church, she vaguely associated with oaths,
slammed doors, and other evidences of ill-breeding; but
Amherst had been swept too far on the flood of his indignation
to be checked by such small signs of disapproval.</p>

<p>"You'll say that what I'm asking you is to give me
back the free use of your money. Well! Why not?
Is it so much for a wife to give? I know you all think
that a man who marries a rich woman forfeits his self-respect
if he spends a penny without her approval. But
that's because money is so sacred to you all! It seems
to me the least important thing that a woman entrusts
to her husband. What of her dreams and her hopes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[p 324]</a></span>
her belief in justice and goodness and decency? If he
takes those and destroys them, he'd better have had a
mill-stone about his neck. But nobody has a word to
say till he touches her dividends&mdash;then he's a calculating
brute who has married her for her fortune!"</p>

<p>He had come close again, facing her with outstretched
hands, half-commanding, half in appeal. "Don't you
see that I can't go on in this way&mdash;that I've <i>no right</i> to
let you keep me from Westmore?"</p>

<p>Bessy was looking at him coldly, under the half-dropped
lids of indifference. "I hardly know what you
mean&mdash;you use such peculiar words; but I don't see
why you should expect me to give up all the ideas I was
brought up in. Our standards <i>are</i> different&mdash;but why
should yours always be right?"</p>

<p>"You believed they were right when you married me&mdash;have
they changed since then?"</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;&mdash;" Her face seemed to harden and
contract into a small expressionless mask, in which he
could no longer read anything but blank opposition to
his will.</p>

<p>"You trusted my judgment not long ago," he went
on, "when I asked you to give up seeing Mrs. Carbury&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She flushed, but with anger, not compunction. "It
seems to me that should be a reason for your not asking
me to make other sacrifices! When I gave up Blanche<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[p 325]</a></span>
I thought you would see that I wanted to please you&mdash;and
that you would do something for me in return...."</p>

<p>Amherst interrupted her with a laugh. "Thank you
for telling me your real reasons. I was fool enough to
think you acted from conviction&mdash;not that you were
simply striking a bargain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, and they looked at each other with a
kind of fear, each hearing between them the echo of
irreparable words. Amherst's only clear feeling was
that he must not speak again till he had beaten down
the horrible sensation in his breast&mdash;the rage of hate
which had him in its grip, and which made him almost
afraid, while it lasted, to let his eyes rest on the fair
weak creature before him. Bessy, too, was in the
clutch of a mute anger which slowly poured its benumbing
current around her heart. Strong waves of
passion did not quicken her vitality: she grew inert and
cold under their shock. Only one little pulse of self-pity
continued to beat in her, trembling out at last on
the cry: "Ah, I know it's not because you care so much
for Westmore&mdash;it's only because you want to get away
from me!"</p>

<p>Amherst stared as if her words had flashed a light
into the darkest windings of his misery. "Yes&mdash;I
want to get away..." he said; and he turned and
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>He went down to the smoking-room, and ringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[p 326]</a></span>
for a servant, ordered his horse to be saddled. The
foot-man who answered his summons brought the
afternoon's mail, and Amherst, throwing himself down
on the sofa, began to tear open his letters while he
waited.</p>

<p>He ran through the first few without knowing what
he read; but presently his attention was arrested by the
hand-writing of a man he had known well in college,
and who had lately come into possession of a large
cotton-mill in the South. He wrote now to ask if
Amherst could recommend a good manager&mdash;"not
one of your old routine men, but a young fellow with
the new ideas. Things have been in pretty bad shape
down here," the writer added, "and now that I'm in
possession I want to see what can be done to civilize
the place"; and he went on to urge that Amherst
should come down himself to inspect the mills, and
propose such improvements as his experience suggested.
"We've all heard of the great things you're doing at
Westmore," the letter ended; and Amherst cast it
from him with a groan....</p>

<p>It was Duplain's chance, of course...that was
his first thought. He took up the letter and read it
over. He knew the man who wrote&mdash;no sentimentalist
seeking emotional variety from vague philanthropic
experiments, but a serious student of social conditions,
now unexpectedly provided with the opportunity to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[p 327]</a></span>
apply his ideas. Yes, it was Duplain's chance&mdash;if
indeed it might not be his own!... Amherst sat
upright, dazzled by the thought. Why Duplain&mdash;why
not himself? Bessy had spoken the illuminating word&mdash;what
he wanted was to get away&mdash;to get away at
any cost! Escape had become his one thought: escape
from the bondage of Lynbrook, from the bitter
memory of his failure at Westmore; and here was the
chance to escape back into life&mdash;into independence,
activity and usefulness! Every atrophied faculty in
him suddenly started from its torpor, and his brain
throbbed with the pain of the awakening.... The
servant came to tell him that his horse waited, and he
sprang up, took his riding-whip from the rack, stared a
moment, absently, after the man's retreating back, and
then dropped down again on the sofa....</p>

<p>What was there to keep him from accepting? His
wife's affection was dead&mdash;if her sentimental fancy for
him had ever deserved the name! And his passing
mastery over her was gone too&mdash;he smiled to remember
that, hardly two hours earlier, he had been fatuous
enough to think he could still regain it! Now he said
to himself that she would sooner desert a friend to
please him than sacrifice a fraction of her income; and
the discovery cast a stain of sordidness on their whole
relation. He could still imagine struggling to win her
back from another man, or even to save her from some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[p 328]</a></span>
folly into which mistaken judgment or perverted enthusiasm
might have hurried her; but to go on battling
against the dull unimaginative subservience to personal
luxury&mdash;the slavery to houses and servants and clothes&mdash;ah,
no, while he had any fight left in him it was worth
spending in a better cause than that!</p>

<p>Through the open window he could hear, in the mild
December stillness, his horse's feet coming and going
on the gravel. <i>Her</i> horse, led up and down by <i>her</i>
servant, at the door of <i>her</i> house!... The sound symbolized
his whole future...the situation his marriage
had made for him, and to which he must henceforth
bend, unless he broke with it then and there.... He
tried to look ahead, to follow up, one by one, the consequences
of such a break. That it would be final he
had no doubt. There are natures which seem to be
drawn closer by dissension, to depend, for the renewal
of understanding, on the spark of generosity and compunction
that anger strikes out of both; but Amherst
knew that between himself and his wife no such clearing
of the moral atmosphere was possible. The indignation
which left him with tingling nerves and a
burning need of some immediate escape into action,
crystallized in Bessy into a hard kernel of obstinacy,
into which, after each fresh collision, he felt that a
little more of herself had been absorbed.... No, the
break between them would be final&mdash;if he went now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[p 329]</a></span>
he would not come back. And it flashed across him
that this solution might have been foreseen by his wife&mdash;might
even have been deliberately planned and led
up to by those about her. His father-in-law had never
liked him&mdash;the disturbing waves of his activity had
rippled even the sheltered surface of Mr. Langhope's
existence. He must have been horribly in their way!
Well&mdash;it was not too late to take himself out of it. In
Bessy's circle the severing of such ties was regarded as
an expensive but unhazardous piece of surgery&mdash;nobody
bled to death of the wound.... The footman came
back to remind him that his horse was waiting, and
Amherst rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Send him back to the stable," he said with a glance
at his watch, "and order a trap to take me to the next
train."</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Amherst woke, the next morning, in the
hotel to which he had gone up from Lynbrook, he
was oppressed by the sense that the hardest step he had
to take still lay before him. It had been almost easy
to decide that the moment of separation had come, for
circumstances seemed to have closed every other issue
from his unhappy situation; but how tell his wife of
his decision? Amherst, to whom action was the first
necessity of being, became a weak procrastinator when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[p 330]</a></span>
he was confronted by the need of writing instead of
speaking.</p>

<p>To account for his abrupt departure from Lynbrook
he had left word that he was called to town on business;
but, since he did not mean to return, some farther explanation
was now necessary, and he was paralyzed by
the difficulty of writing. He had already telegraphed
to his friend that he would be at the mills the next day;
but the southern express did not leave till the afternoon,
and he still had several hours in which to consider what
he should say to his wife. To postpone the dreaded
task, he invented the pretext of some business to be
despatched, and taking the Subway to Wall Street consumed
the morning in futile activities. But since the
renunciation of his work at Westmore he had no active
concern with the financial world, and by twelve o'clock
he had exhausted his imaginary affairs and was journeying
up town again. He left the train at Union Square, and
walked along Fourth Avenue, now definitely resolved to
go back to the hotel and write his letter before lunching.</p>

<p>At Twenty-sixth Street he had struck into Madison
Avenue, and was striding onward with the fixed eye and
aimless haste of the man who has empty hours to fill,
when a hansom drew up ahead of him and Justine
Brent sprang out. She was trimly dressed, as if for
travel, with a small bag in her hand; but at sight of
him she paused with a cry of pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[p 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Amherst, I'm so glad! I was afraid I
might not see you for goodbye."</p>

<p>"For goodbye?" Amherst paused, embarrassed.
How had she guessed that he did not mean to return
to Lynbrook?</p>

<p>"You know," she reminded him, "I'm going to some
friends near Philadelphia for ten days"&mdash;and he remembered
confusedly that a long time ago&mdash;probably
yesterday morning&mdash;he had heard her speak of her
projected visit.</p>

<p>"I had no idea," she continued, "that you were
coming up to town yesterday, or I should have tried
to see you before you left. I wanted to ask you to
send me a line if Bessy needs me&mdash;I'll come back at
once if she does." Amherst continued to listen blankly,
as if making a painful effort to regain some consciousness
of what was being said to him, and she went on:
"She seemed so nervous and poorly yesterday evening
that I was sorry I had decided to go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her intent gaze reminded him that the emotions of
the last twenty-four hours must still be visible in his
face; and the thought of what she might detect helped
to restore his self-possession. "You must not think of
giving up your visit," he began hurriedly&mdash;he had
meant to add "on account of Bessy," but he found
himself unable to utter his wife's name.</p>

<p>Justine was still looking at him. "Oh, I'm sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[p 332]</a></span>
everything will be all right," she rejoined. "You go
back this afternoon, I suppose? I've left you a little
note, with my address, and I want you to promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, for Amherst had made a motion as
though to interrupt her. The old confused sense that
there must always be truth between them was struggling
in him with the strong restraints of habit and
character; and suddenly, before he was conscious of
having decided to speak, he heard himself say: "I
ought to tell you that I am not going back."</p>

<p>"Not going back?" A flash of apprehension crossed
Justine's face. "Not till tomorrow, you mean?" she
added, recovering herself.</p>

<p>Amherst hesitated, glancing vaguely up and down
the street. At that noonday hour it was nearly deserted,
and Justine's driver dozed on his perch above
the hansom. They could speak almost as openly as
if they had been in one of the wood-paths at Lynbrook.</p>

<p>"Nor tomorrow," Amherst said in a low voice. There
was another pause before he added: "It may be some
time before&mdash;" He broke off, and then continued with
an effort: "The fact is, I am thinking of going back to
my old work."</p>

<p>She caught him up with an exclamation of surprise
and sympathy. "Your old work? You mean at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was checked by the quick contraction of pain in
his face. "Not that! I mean that I'm thinking of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[p 333]</a></span>
taking a new job&mdash;as manager of a Georgia mill....
It's the only thing I know how to do, and I've got to do
something&mdash;" He forced a laugh. "The habit of
work is incurable!"</p>

<p>Justine's face had grown as grave as his. She hesitated
a moment, looking down the street toward the
angle of Madison Square, which was visible from the
corner where they stood.</p>

<p>"Will you walk back to the square with me? Then
we can sit down a moment."</p>

<p>She began to move as she spoke, and he walked beside
her in silence till they had gained the seat she pointed
out. Her hansom trailed after them, drawing up at the
corner.</p>

<p>As Amherst sat down beside her, Justine turned to
him with an air of quiet resolution. "Mr. Amherst&mdash;will
you let me ask you something? Is this a sudden
decision?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I decided yesterday."</p>

<p>"And Bessy&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>His glance dropped for the first time, but Justine
pressed her point. "Bessy approves?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she will, I think&mdash;when she knows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When she knows?" Her emotion sprang into her
face. "When she knows? Then she does not&mdash;yet?"</p>

<p>"No. The offer came suddenly. I must go at
once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[p 334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Without seeing her?" She cut him short with a
quick commanding gesture. "Mr. Amherst, you can't
do this&mdash;you won't do it! You will not go away without
seeing Bessy!" she said.</p>

<p>Her eyes sought his and drew them upward, constraining
them to meet the full beam of her rebuking
gaze.</p>

<p>"I must do what seems best under the circumstances,"
he answered hesitatingly. "She will hear from me, of
course; I shall write today&mdash;and later&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not later! <i>Now</i>&mdash;you will go back now to Lynbrook!
Such things can't be told in writing&mdash;if they
must be said at all, they must be spoken. Don't tell
me that I don't understand&mdash;or that I'm meddling in
what doesn't concern me. I don't care a fig for that!
I've always meddled in what didn't concern me&mdash;I
always shall, I suppose, till I die! And I understand
enough to know that Bessy is very unhappy&mdash;and that
you're the wiser and stronger of the two. I know what
it's been to you to give up your work&mdash;to feel yourself
useless," she interrupted herself, with softening eyes,
"and I know how you've tried...I've watched you...but
Bessy has tried too; and even if you've both failed&mdash;if
you've come to the end of your resources&mdash;it's
for you to face the fact, and help her face it&mdash;not to
run away from it like this!"</p>

<p>Amherst sat silent under the assault of her eloquence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[p 335]</a></span>
He was conscious of no instinctive resentment, no
sense that she was, as she confessed, meddling in
matters which did not concern her. His ebbing spirit
was revived by the shock of an ardour like his own.
She had not shrunk from calling him a coward&mdash;and
it did him good to hear her call him so! Her words
put life back into its true perspective, restored their
meaning to obsolete terms: to truth and manliness
and courage. He had lived so long among equivocations
that he had forgotten how to look a fact in the
face; but here was a woman who judged life by his
own standards&mdash;and by those standards she had found
him wanting!</p>

<p>Still, he could not forget the last bitter hours, or
change his opinion as to the futility of attempting to
remain at Lynbrook. He felt as strongly as ever the
need of moral and mental liberation&mdash;the right to begin
life again on his own terms. But Justine Brent had
made him see that his first step toward self-assertion
had been the inconsistent one of trying to evade its
results.</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;I will go back," he said.</p>

<p>She thanked him with her eyes, as she had thanked
him on the terrace at Lynbrook, on the autumn evening
which had witnessed their first broken exchange of
confidences; and he was struck once more with the
change that feeling produced in her. Emotions flashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[p 336]</a></span>
across her face like the sweep of sun-rent clouds over
a quiet landscape, bringing out the gleam of hidden
waters, the fervour of smouldering colours, all the
subtle delicacies of modelling that are lost under the
light of an open sky. And it was extraordinary how
she could infuse into a principle the warmth and
colour of a passion! If conduct, to most people, seemed
a cold matter of social prudence or inherited habit, to
her it was always the newly-discovered question of her
own relation to life&mdash;as most women see the great
issues only through their own wants and prejudices, so
she seemed always to see her personal desires in the
light of the larger claims.</p>

<p>"But I don't think," Amherst went on, "that anything
can be said to convince me that I ought to alter
my decision. These months of idleness have shown
me that I'm one of the members of society who are a
danger to the community if their noses are not kept to
the grindstone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Justine lowered her eyes musingly, and he saw she
was undergoing the reaction of constraint which always
followed on her bursts of unpremeditated frankness.</p>

<p>"That is not for me to judge," she answered after a
moment. "But if you decide to go away for a time&mdash;surely
it ought to be in such a way that your going
does not seem to cast any reflection on Bessy, or
subject her to any unkind criticism."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[p 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst, reddening slightly, glanced at her in surprise.
"I don't think you need fear that&mdash;I shall be
the only one criticized," he said drily.</p>

<p>"Are you sure&mdash;if you take such a position as you
spoke of? So few people understand the love of hard
work for its own sake. They will say that your quarrel
with your wife has driven you to support yourself&mdash;and
that will be cruel to Bessy."</p>

<p>Amherst shrugged his shoulders. "They'll be more
likely to say I tried to play the gentleman and failed,
and wasn't happy till I got back to my own place in
life&mdash;which is true enough," he added with a touch of
irony.</p>

<p>"They may say that too; but they will make Bessy
suffer first&mdash;and it will be your fault if she is humiliated
in that way. If you decide to take up your factory
work for a time, can't you do so without&mdash;without accepting
a salary? Oh, you see I stick at nothing," she
broke in upon herself with a laugh, "and Bessy has
said things which make me see that she would suffer
horribly if&mdash;if you put such a slight on her." He remained
silent, and she went on urgently: "From
Bessy's standpoint it would mean a decisive break&mdash;the
repudiating of your whole past. And it is a question
on which you can afford to be generous, because I
know...I think...it's less important in your eyes
than hers...."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[p 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst glanced at her quickly. "That particular
form of indebtedness, you mean?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "The easiest to cancel, and therefore
the least galling; isn't that the way you regard it?"</p>

<p>"I used to&mdash;yes; but&mdash;" He was about to add:
"No one at Lynbrook does," but the flash of intelligence
in her eyes restrained him, while at the same
time it seemed to answer: "There's my point! To
see their limitation is to allow for it, since every enlightenment
brings a corresponding obligation."</p>

<p>She made no attempt to put into words the argument
her look conveyed, but rose from her seat with a rapid
glance at her watch.</p>

<p>"And now I must go, or I shall miss my train." She
held out her hand, and as Amherst's met it, he said in
a low tone, as if in reply to her unspoken appeal: "I
shall remember all you have said."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was a new experience for Amherst to be acting under
the pressure of another will; but during his return
journey to Lynbrook that afternoon it was pure relief
to surrender himself to this pressure, and the surrender
brought not a sense of weakness but of recovered energy.
It was not in his nature to analyze his motives, or spend
his strength in weighing closely balanced alternatives
of conduct; and though, during the last purposeless
months, he had grown to brood over every spring of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[p 339]</a></span>
action in himself and others, this tendency disappeared
at once in contact with the deed to be done. It was as
though a tributary stream, gathering its crystal speed
among the hills, had been suddenly poured into the
stagnant waters of his will; and he saw now how thick
and turbid those waters had become&mdash;how full of the
slime-bred life that chokes the springs of courage.</p>

<p>His whole desire now was to be generous to his wife:
to bear the full brunt of whatever pain their parting
brought. Justine had said that Bessy seemed nervous
and unhappy: it was clear, therefore, that she also had
suffered from the wounds they had dealt each other,
though she kept her unmoved front to the last. Poor
child! Perhaps that insensible exterior was the only
way she knew of expressing courage! It seemed to
Amherst that all means of manifesting the finer impulses
must slowly wither in the Lynbrook air. As
he approached his destination, his thoughts of her were
all pitiful: nothing remained of the personal resentment
which had debased their parting. He had telephoned
from town to announce the hour of his return,
and when he emerged from the station he half-expected
to find her seated in the brougham whose lamps signalled
him through the early dusk. It would be like
her to undergo such a reaction of feeling, and to express
it, not in words, but by taking up their relation as
if there had been no break in it. He had once con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[p 340]</a></span>demned
this facility of renewal as a sign of lightness,
a result of that continual evasion of serious issues which
made the life of Bessy's world a thin crust of custom
above a void of thought. But he now saw that, if she
was the product of her environment, that constituted
but another claim on his charity, and made the more
precious any impulses of natural feeling that had survived
the unifying pressure of her life. As he approached
the brougham, he murmured mentally: "What
if I were to try once more?"</p>

<p>Bessy had not come to meet him; but he said to himself
that he should find her alone at the house, and that
he would make his confession at once. As the carriage
passed between the lights on the tall stone gate-posts,
and rolled through the bare shrubberies of the avenue,
he felt a momentary tightening of the heart&mdash;a sense
of stepping back into the trap from which he had just
wrenched himself free&mdash;a premonition of the way in
which the smooth systematized routine of his wife's existence
might draw him back into its revolutions as he
had once seen a careless factory hand seized and dragged
into a flying belt....</p>

<p>But it was only for a moment; then his thoughts reverted
to Bessy. It was she who was to be considered&mdash;this
time he must be strong enough for both.</p>

<p>The butler met him on the threshold, flanked by the
usual array of footmen; and as he saw his portmanteau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[p 341]</a></span>
ceremoniously passed from hand to hand, Amherst
once more felt the steel of the springe on his neck.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Amherst in the drawing-room, Knowles?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Knowles, who had too high a sense
of fitness to volunteer any information beyond the
immediate fact required of him.</p>

<p>"She has gone up to her sitting-room, then?"
Amherst continued, turning toward the broad sweep
of the stairway.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the butler slowly; "Mrs. Amherst
has gone away."</p>

<p>"Gone away?" Amherst stopped short, staring
blankly at the man's smooth official mask.</p>

<p>"This afternoon, sir; to Mapleside."</p>

<p>"To Mapleside?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, by motor&mdash;to stay with Mrs. Carbury."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. It had all happened
so quickly that Amherst, with the dual vision which
comes at such moments, noticed that the third footman&mdash;or
was it the fourth?&mdash;was just passing his
portmanteau on to a shirt-sleeved arm behind the door
which led to the servant's wing....</p>

<p>He roused himself to look at the tall clock. It
was just six. He had telephoned from town at
two.</p>

<p>"At what time did Mrs. Amherst leave?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[p 342]</a></span></p>

<p>The butler meditated. "Sharp at four, sir. The
maid took the three-forty with the luggage."</p>

<p>With the luggage! So it was not a mere one-night
visit. The blood rose slowly to Amherst's face. The
footmen had disappeared, but presently the door at
the back of the hall reopened, and one of them came
out, carrying an elaborately-appointed tea-tray toward
the smoking-room. The routine of the house was
going on as if nothing had happened.... The butler
looked at Amherst with respectful&mdash;too respectful&mdash;interrogation,
and he was suddenly conscious that
he was standing motionless in the middle of the hall,
with one last intolerable question on his lips.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;it had to be spoken! "Did Mrs. Amherst
receive my telephone message?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I gave it to her myself."</p>

<p>It occurred confusedly to Amherst that a well-bred
man&mdash;as Lynbrook understood the phrase&mdash;would, at
this point, have made some tardy feint of being in his
wife's confidence, of having, on second thoughts, no
reason to be surprised at her departure. It was humiliating,
he supposed, to be thus laying bare his discomfiture
to his dependents&mdash;he could see that even
Knowles was affected by the manifest impropriety of
the situation&mdash;but no pretext presented itself to his
mind, and after another interval of silence he turned
slowly toward the door of the smoking-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[p 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"My letters are here, I suppose?" he paused on the
threshold to enquire; and on the butler's answering in
the affirmative, he said to himself, with a last effort
to suspend his judgment: "She has left a line&mdash;there
will be some explanation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was nothing&mdash;neither word nor message;
nothing but the reverberating retort of her departure
in the face of his return&mdash;her flight to Blanche Carbury
as the final answer to his final appeal.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Justine</span> was coming back to Lynbrook.
She had been, after all, unable to stay out the ten
days of her visit: the undefinable sense of being needed,
so often the determining motive of her actions, drew her
back to Long Island at the end of the week. She had
received no word from Amherst or Bessy; only Cicely
had told her, in a big round hand, that mother had been
away three days, and that it had been very lonely, and
that the housekeeper's cat had kittens, and she was to
have one; and were kittens christened, or how did
they get their names?&mdash;because she wanted to call hers
Justine; and she had found in her book a bird like the
one father had shown them in the swamp; and they
were not alone now, because the Telfers were there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[p 344]</a></span>
and they had all been out sleighing; but it would be
much nicer when Justine came back....</p>

<p>It was as difficult to extract any sequence of facts
from Cicely's letter as from an early chronicle. She
made no reference to Amherst's return, which was odd,
since she was fond of her step-father, yet not significant,
since the fact of his arrival might have been
crowded out by the birth of the kittens, or some incident
equally prominent in her perspectiveless grouping
of events; nor did she name the date of her mother's
departure, so that Justine could not guess whether it
had been contingent on Amherst's return, or wholly
unconnected with it. What puzzled her most was
Bessy's own silence&mdash;yet that too, in a sense, was
reassuring, for Bessy thought of others chiefly when it
was painful to think of herself, and her not writing
implied that she had felt no present need of her
friend's sympathy.</p>

<p>Justine did not expect to find Amherst at Lynbrook.
She had felt convinced, when they parted, that he
would persist in his plan of going south; and the fact
that the Telfer girls were again in possession made it
seem probable that he had already left. Under the circumstances,
Justine thought the separation advisable;
but she was eager to be assured that it had been effected
amicably, and without open affront to Bessy's pride.</p>

<p>She arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[p 345]</a></span>
entered the house the sound of voices from the drawing-room,
and the prevailing sense of bustle and movement
amid which her own coming was evidently an
unconsidered detail, showed that the normal life of
Lynbrook had resumed its course. The Telfers, as
usual, had brought a lively throng in their train; and
amid the bursts of merriment about the drawing-room
tea-table she caught Westy Gaines's impressive accents,
and the screaming laughter of Blanche Carbury....</p>

<p>So Blanche Carbury was back at Lynbrook! The
discovery gave Justine fresh cause for conjecture.
Whatever reciprocal concessions might have resulted
from Amherst's return to his wife, it seemed hardly
probable that they included a renewal of relations with
Mrs. Carbury. Had his mission failed then&mdash;had he
and Bessy parted in anger, and was Mrs. Carbury's
presence at Lynbrook Bessy's retort to his assertion of
independence?</p>

<p>In the school-room, where Justine was received with
the eager outpouring of Cicely's minutest experiences,
she dared not put the question that would have solved
these doubts; and she left to dress for dinner without
knowing whether Amherst had returned to Lynbrook.
Yet in her heart she never questioned that he had done
so; all her fears revolved about what had since taken
place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[p 346]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw Bessy first in the drawing-room, surrounded
by her guests; and their brief embrace told her nothing,
except that she had never beheld her friend more
brilliant, more triumphantly in possession of recovered
spirits and health.</p>

<p>That Amherst was absent was now made evident by
Bessy's requesting Westy Gaines to lead the way to
the dining-room with Mrs. Ansell, who was one of the
reassembled visitors; and the only one, as Justine
presently observed, not in key with the prevailing
gaiety. Mrs. Ansell, usually so tinged with the colours
of her environment, preserved on this occasion a grey
neutrality of tone which was the only break in the
general brightness. It was not in her graceful person
to express anything as gross as disapproval, yet that
sentiment was manifest, to the nice observer, in a delicate
aloofness which made the waves of laughter fall
back from her, and spread a circle of cloudy calm
about her end of the table. Justine had never been
greatly drawn to Mrs. Ansell. Her own adaptability
was not in the least akin to the older woman's studied
self-effacement; and the independence of judgment
which Justine preserved in spite of her perception of
divergent standpoints made her a little contemptuous
of an excess of charity that seemed to have been acquired
at the cost of all individual convictions. To-night
for the first time she felt in Mrs. Ansell a secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[p 347]</a></span>
sympathy with her own fears; and a sense of this tacit
understanding made her examine with sudden interest
the face of her unexpected ally.... After all, what
did she know of Mrs. Ansell's history&mdash;of the hidden
processes which had gradually subdued her own passions
and desires, making of her, as it were, a mere
decorative background, a connecting link between
other personalities? Perhaps, for a woman alone in
the world, without the power and opportunity that
money gives, there was no alternative between letting
one's individuality harden into a small dry nucleus of
egoism, or diffuse itself thus in the interstices of other
lives&mdash;and there fell upon Justine the chill thought that
just such a future might await her if she missed the
liberating gift of personal happiness....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Neither that night nor the next day had she a private
word with Bessy&mdash;and it became evident, as the hours
passed, that Mrs. Amherst was deliberately postponing
the moment when they should find themselves alone.
But the Lynbrook party was to disperse on the Monday;
and Bessy, who hated early rising, and all the details
of housekeeping, tapped at Justine's door late on Sunday
night to ask her to speed the departing visitors.</p>

<p>She pleaded this necessity as an excuse for her intrusion,
and the playful haste of her manner showed a
nervous shrinking from any renewal of confidence; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[p 348]</a></span>
as she leaned in the doorway, fingering the diamond
chain about her neck, while one satin-tipped foot
emerged restlessly from the edge of her lace gown, her
face lost the bloom of animation which talk and
laughter always produced in it, and she looked so pale
and weary that Justine needed no better pretext for
drawing her into the room.</p>

<p>It was not in Bessy to resist a soothing touch in her
moments of nervous reaction. She sank into the chair
by the fire and let her head rest wearily against the
cushion which Justine slipped behind it.</p>

<p>Justine dropped into the low seat beside her, and
laid a hand on hers. "You don't look as well as when
I went away, Bessy. Are you sure you've done wisely
in beginning your house-parties so soon?"</p>

<p>It always alarmed Bessy to be told that she was not
looking her best, and she sat upright, a wave of pink
rising under her sensitive skin.</p>

<p>"I am quite well, on the contrary; but I was dying
of inanition in this big empty house, and I suppose I
haven't got the boredom out of my system yet!"</p>

<p>Justine recognized the echo of Mrs. Carbury's manner.</p>

<p>"Even if you <i>were</i> bored," she rejoined, "the inanition
was probably good for you. What does Dr.
Wyant say to your breaking away from his r&eacute;gime?"
She named Wyant purposely, knowing that Bessy had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[p 349]</a></span>
that respect for the medical verdict which is the last
trace of reverence for authority in the mind of the
modern woman. But Mrs. Amherst laughed with
gentle malice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't seen Dr. Wyant lately. His interest
in me died out the day you left."</p>

<p>Justine forced a laugh to hide her annoyance. She
had not yet recovered from the shrinking disgust of her
last scene with Wyant.</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose, Bessy. If he hasn't come, it must
be because you've told him not to&mdash;because you're
afraid of letting him see that you're disobeying him."</p>

<p>Bessy laughed again. "My dear, I'm afraid of nothing&mdash;nothing!
Not even of your big eyes when they
glare at me like coals. I suppose you must have looked
at poor Wyant like that to frighten him away! And
yet the last time we talked of him you seemed to like
him&mdash;you even hinted that it was because of him that
Westy had no chance."</p>

<p>Justine uttered an impatient exclamation. "If
neither of them existed it wouldn't affect the other's
chances in the least. Their only merit is that they
both enhance the charms of celibacy!"</p>

<p>Bessy's smile dropped, and she turned a grave glance
on her friend. "Ah, most men do that&mdash;you're so
clever to have found it out!"</p>

<p>It was Justine's turn to smile. "Oh, but I haven't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[p 350]</a></span>&mdash;as
a generalization. I mean to marry as soon as I get
the chance!"</p>

<p>"The chance&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"To meet the right man. I'm gambler enough to
believe in my luck yet!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst sighed compassionately. "There <i>is</i>
no right man! As Blanche says, matrimony's as uncomfortable
as a ready-made shoe. How can one and
the same institution fit every individual case? And
why should we all have to go lame because marriage
was once invented to suit an imaginary case?"</p>

<p>Justine gave a slight shrug. "You talk of walking
lame&mdash;how else do we all walk? It seems to me that
life's the tight boot, and marriage the crutch that may
help one to hobble along!" She drew Bessy's hand
into hers with a caressing pressure. "When you philosophize
I always know you're tired. No one who
feels well stops to generalize about symptoms. If you
won't let your doctor prescribe for you, your nurse is
going to carry out his orders. What you want is quiet.
Be reasonable and send away everybody before Mr.
Amherst comes back!"</p>

<p>She dropped the last phrase carelessly, glancing away
as she spoke; but the stiffening of the fingers in her
clasp sent a little tremor through her hand.</p>

<p>"Thanks for your advice. It would be excellent but
for one thing&mdash;my husband is not coming back!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[p 351]</a></span></p>

<p>The mockery in Bessy's voice seemed to pass into
her features, hardening and contracting them as frost
shrivels a flower. Justine's face, on the contrary, was
suddenly illuminated by compassion, as though a light
had struck up into it from the cold glitter of her friend's
unhappiness.</p>

<p>"Bessy! What do you mean by not coming back?"</p>

<p>"I mean he's had the tact to see that we shall be
more comfortable apart&mdash;without putting me to the
unpleasant necessity of telling him so."</p>

<p>Again the piteous echo of Blanche Carbury's phrases!
The laboured mimicry of her ideas!</p>

<p>Justine looked anxiously at her friend. It seemed
horribly false not to mention her own talk with Amherst,
yet she felt it wiser to feign ignorance, since
Bessy could never be trusted to interpret rightly any
departure from the conventional.</p>

<p>"Please tell me what has happened," she said at length.</p>

<p>Bessy, with a smile, released her hand. "John has
gone back to the life he prefers&mdash;which I take to be
a hint to me to do the same."</p>

<p>Justine hesitated again; then the pressure of truth
overcame every barrier of expediency. "Bessy&mdash;I
ought to tell you that I saw Mr. Amherst in town the
day I went to Philadelphia. He spoke of going away
for a time...he seemed unhappy...but he told me
he was coming back to see you first&mdash;" She broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[p 352]</a></span>
off, her clear eyes on her friend's; and she saw at
once that Bessy was too self-engrossed to feel any surprise
at her avowal. "Surely he came back?" she
went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;he came back!" Bessy sank into the
cushions, watching the firelight play on her diamond
chain as she repeated the restless gesture of lifting it
up and letting it slip through her fingers.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;nothing! I was not here when he came."</p>

<p>"You were not here? What had happened?"</p>

<p>"I had gone over to Blanche Carbury's for a day
or two. I was just leaving when I heard he was coming
back, and I couldn't throw her over at the last moment."</p>

<p>Justine tried to catch the glance that fluttered evasively
under Bessy's lashes. "You knew he was coming&mdash;and
you chose that time to go to Mrs. Carbury's?"</p>

<p>"I didn't choose, my dear&mdash;it just happened! And
it really happened for the best. I suppose he was
annoyed at my going&mdash;you know he has a ridiculous
prejudice against Blanche&mdash;and so the next morning
he rushed off to his cotton mill."</p>

<p>There was a pause, while the diamonds continued to
flow in threads of fire through Mrs. Amherst's fingers.</p>

<p>At length Justine said: "Did Mr. Amherst know
that you knew he was coming back before you left for
Mrs. Carbury's?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[p 353]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessy feigned to meditate the question. "Did he
know that I knew that he knew?" she mocked. "Yes&mdash;I
suppose so&mdash;he must have known." She stifled
a slight yawn as she drew herself languidly to her feet.</p>

<p>"Then he took that as your answer?"</p>

<p>"My answer&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"To his coming back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So it appears. I told you he had shown unusual
tact." Bessy stretched her softly tapering arms above
her head and then dropped them along her sides with
another yawn. "But it's almost morning&mdash;it's wicked
of me to have kept you so late, when you must be up
to look after all those people!"</p>

<p>She flung her arms with a light gesture about Justine's
shoulders, and laid a dry kiss on her cheek.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me with those big eyes&mdash;they've
eaten up the whole of your face! And you needn't
think I'm sorry for what I've done," she declared.
"I'm <i>not</i>&mdash;the&mdash;least&mdash;little&mdash;atom&mdash;of a bit!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Justine</span> was pacing the long library at Lynbrook,
between the caged sets of standard authors.</p>

<p>She felt as much caged as they: as much a part of a
conventional stage-setting totally unrelated to the
action going on before it. Two weeks had passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[p 354]</a></span>
since her return from Philadelphia; and during that
time she had learned that her usefulness at Lynbrook
was over. Though not unwelcome, she might almost
call herself unwanted; life swept by, leaving her tethered
to the stake of inaction; a bitter lot for one who
chose to measure existence by deeds instead of days.
She had found Bessy ostensibly busy with a succession
of guests; no one in the house needed her but Cicely,
and even Cicely, at times, was caught up into the
whirl of her mother's life, swept off on sleighing parties
and motor-trips, or carried to town for a dancing-class
or an opera matin&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton Carbury was not among the visitors
who left Lynbrook on the Monday after Justine's return.</p>

<p>Mr. Carbury, with the other bread-winners of the
party, had hastened back to his treadmill in Wall Street
after a Sunday spent in silently studying the files of the
Financial Record; but his wife stayed on, somewhat
aggressively in possession, criticizing and rearranging
the furniture, ringing for the servants, making sudden
demands on the stable, telegraphing, telephoning, ordering
fires lighted or windows opened, and leaving
everywhere in her wake a trail of cigarette ashes and
cocktail glasses.</p>

<p>Ned Bowfort had not been included in the house-party;
but on the day of its dispersal he rode over unannounced
for luncheon, put up his horse in the stable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[p 355]</a></span>
threaded his way familiarly among the dozing dogs in
the hall, greeted Mrs. Ansell and Justine with just the
right shade of quiet deference, produced from his
pocket a new puzzle-game for Cicely, and sat down
beside her mother with the quiet urbanity of the family
friend who knows his privileges but is too discreet to
abuse them.</p>

<p>After that he came every day, sometimes riding home
late to the Hunt Club, sometimes accompanying Bessy
and Mrs. Carbury to town for dinner and the theatre;
but always with his deprecating air of having dropped
in by accident, and modestly hoping that his intrusion
was not unwelcome.</p>

<p>The following Sunday brought another influx of
visitors, and Bessy seemed to fling herself with renewed
enthusiasm into the cares of hospitality. She had
avoided Justine since their midnight talk, contriving to
see her in Cicely's presence, or pleading haste when
they found themselves alone. The winter was unusually
open, and she spent long hours in the saddle
when her time was not taken up with her visitors. For
a while she took Cicely on her daily rides; but she
soon wearied of adapting her hunter's stride to the
pace of the little girl's pony, and Cicely was once more
given over to the coachman's care.</p>

<p>Then came snow and a long frost, and Bessy grew
restless at her imprisonment, and grumbled that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[p 356]</a></span>
was no way of keeping well in a winter climate which
made regular exercise impossible.</p>

<p>"Why not build a squash-court?" Blanche Carbury
proposed; and the two fell instantly to making plans
under the guidance of Ned Bowfort and Westy Gaines.
As the scheme developed, various advisers suggested
that it was a pity not to add a bowling-alley, a swimming-tank
and a gymnasium; a fashionable architect
was summoned from town, measurements were taken,
sites discussed, sketches compared, and engineers consulted
as to the cost of artesian wells and the best
system for heating the tank.</p>

<p>Bessy seemed filled with a feverish desire to carry
out the plan as quickly as possible, and on as large a
scale as even the architect's invention soared to; but
it was finally decided that, before signing the contracts,
she should run over to New Jersey to see a building of
the same kind on which a sporting friend of Mrs. Carbury's
had recently lavished a fortune.</p>

<p>It was on this errand that the two ladies, in company
with Westy Gaines and Bowfort, had departed on the
day which found Justine restlessly measuring the
length of the library. She and Mrs. Ansell had the
house to themselves; and it was hardly a surprise to
her when, in the course of the afternoon, Mrs. Ansell,
after a discreet pause on the threshold, advanced toward
her down the long room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[p 357]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the night of her return Justine had felt sure
that Mrs. Ansell would speak; but the elder lady was
given to hawk-like circlings about her subject, to
hanging over it and contemplating it before her wings
dropped for the descent.</p>

<p>Now, however, it was plain that she had resolved to
strike; and Justine had a sense of relief at the thought.
She had been too long isolated in her anxiety, her powerlessness
to help; and she had a vague hope that Mrs.
Ansell's worldly wisdom might accomplish what her
inexperience had failed to achieve.</p>

<p>"Shall we sit by the fire? I am glad to find you
alone," Mrs. Ansell began, with the pleasant abruptness
that was one of the subtlest instruments of her
indirection; and as Justine acquiesced, she added,
yielding her slight lines to the luxurious depths of an
arm-chair: "I have been rather suddenly asked by an
invalid cousin to go to Europe with her next week, and
I can't go contentedly without being at peace about
our friends."</p>

<p>She paused, but Justine made no answer. In spite
of her growing sympathy for Mrs. Ansell she could not
overcome an inherent distrust, not of her methods, but
of her ultimate object. What, for instance, was her
conception of being at peace about the Amhersts?
Justine's own conviction was that, as far as their final
welfare was concerned, any terms were better between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[p 358]</a></span>
them than the external harmony which had prevailed
during Amherst's stay at Lynbrook.</p>

<p>The subtle emanation of her distrust may have been
felt by Mrs. Ansell; for the latter presently continued,
with a certain nobleness: "I am the more concerned
because I believe I must hold myself, in a small degree,
responsible for Bessy's marriage&mdash;" and, as Justine
looked at her in surprise, she added: "I thought she
could never be happy unless her affections were satisfied&mdash;and
even now I believe so."</p>

<p>"I believe so too," Justine said, surprised into assent
by the simplicity of Mrs. Ansell's declaration.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;since we are agreed in our diagnosis,"
the older woman went on, smiling, "what remedy do
you suggest? Or rather, how can we administer it?"</p>

<p>"What remedy?" Justine hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe we are agreed on that too. Mr.
Amherst must be brought back&mdash;but how to bring
him?" She paused, and then added, with a singular
effect of appealing frankness: "I ask you, because I
believe you to be the only one of Bessy's friends who
is in the least in her husband's confidence."</p>

<p>Justine's embarrassment increased. Would it not be
disloyal both to Bessy and Amherst to acknowledge to
a third person a fact of which Bessy herself was unaware?
Yet to betray embarrassment under Mrs. Ansell's
eyes was to risk giving it a dangerous significance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[p 359]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bessy has spoken to me once or twice&mdash;but I know
very little of Mr. Amherst's point of view; except,"
Justine added, after another moment's weighing of
alternatives, "that I believe he suffers most from being
cut off from his work at Westmore."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;so I think; but that is a difficulty that time
and expediency must adjust. All <i>we</i> can do&mdash;their
friends, I mean&mdash;is to get them together again before
the breach is too wide."</p>

<p>Justine pondered. She was perhaps more ignorant
of the situation than Mrs. Ansell imagined, for since her
talk with Bessy the latter had not again alluded to
Amherst's absence, and Justine could merely conjecture
that he had carried out his plan of taking the
management of the mill he had spoken of. What
she most wished to know was whether he had listened
to her entreaty, and taken the position temporarily,
without binding himself by the acceptance of a salary;
or whether, wounded by the outrage of Bessy's flight,
he had freed himself from financial dependence by
engaging himself definitely as manager.</p>

<p>"I really know very little of the present situation,"
Justine said, looking at Mrs. Ansell. "Bessy merely
told me that Mr. Amherst had taken up his old work
in a cotton mill in the south."</p>

<p>As her eyes met Mrs. Ansell's it flashed across her
that the latter did not believe what she said, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[p 360]</a></span>
perception made her instantly shrink back into herself.
But there was nothing in Mrs. Ansell's tone to confirm
the doubt which her look betrayed.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I hoped you knew more," she said simply;
"for, like you, I have only heard from Bessy that her
husband went away suddenly to help a friend who is
reorganizing some mills in Georgia. Of course, under
the circumstances, such a temporary break is natural
enough&mdash;perhaps inevitable&mdash;only he must not stay
away too long."</p>

<p>Justine was silent. Mrs. Ansell's momentary self-betrayal
had checked all farther possibility of frank
communion, and the discerning lady had seen her error
too late to remedy it.</p>

<p>But her hearer's heart gave a leap of joy. It was
clear from what Mrs. Ansell said that Amherst had not
bound himself definitely, since he would not have done
so without informing his wife. And with a secret thrill
of happiness Justine recalled his last word to her: "I
will remember all you have said."</p>

<p>He had kept that word and acted on it; in spite of
Bessy's last assault on his pride he had borne with her,
and deferred the day of final rupture; and the sense
that she had had a part in his decision filled Justine
with a glow of hope. The consciousness of Mrs. Ansell's
suspicions faded to insignificance&mdash;Mrs. Ansell
and her kind might think what they chose, since all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[p 361]</a></span>
that mattered now was that she herself should act bravely
and circumspectly in her last attempt to save her friends.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," Mrs. Ansell continued, gently
scrutinizing her companion, "that I think it unwise of
him to have gone; but if he stays too long Bessy may
listen to bad advice&mdash;advice disastrous to her happiness."
She paused, and turned her eyes meditatively
toward the fire. "As far as I know," she said, with
the same air of serious candour, "you are the only
person who can tell him this."</p>

<p>"I?" exclaimed Justine, with a leap of colour to her
pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell's eyes continued to avoid her. "My
dear Miss Brent, Bessy has told me something of the
wise counsels you have given her. Mr. Amherst is
also your friend. As I said just now, you are the only
person who might act as a link between them&mdash;surely
you will not renounce the r&ocirc;le."</p>

<p>Justine controlled herself. "My only r&ocirc;le, as you
call it, has been to urge Bessy to&mdash;to try to allow for
her husband's views&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And have you not given the same advice to Mr.
Amherst?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the two women met. "Yes," said Justine,
after a moment.</p>

<p>"Then why refuse your help now? The moment is
crucial."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[p 362]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine's thoughts had flown beyond the stage of resenting
Mrs. Ansell's gentle pertinacity. All her faculties
were absorbed in the question as to how she could
most effectually use whatever influence she possessed.</p>

<p>"I put it to you as one old friend to another&mdash;will
you write to Mr. Amherst to come back?" Mrs. Ansell
urged her.</p>

<p>Justine was past considering even the strangeness of
this request, and its oblique reflection on the kind of
power ascribed to her. Through the confused beatings
of her heart she merely struggled for a clearer sense of
guidance.</p>

<p>"No," she said slowly. "I cannot."</p>

<p>"You cannot? With a friend's happiness in extremity?"
Mrs. Ansell paused a moment before she
added. "Unless you believe that Bessy would be happier
divorced?"</p>

<p>"Divorced&mdash;? Oh, no," Justine shuddered.</p>

<p>"That is what it will come to."</p>

<p>"No, no! In time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Time is what I am most afraid of, when Blanche
Carbury disposes of it."</p>

<p>Justine breathed a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"You'll write?" Mrs. Ansell murmured, laying a
soft touch on her hand.</p>

<p>"I have not the influence you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you do any harm by trying?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[p 363]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might&mdash;" Justine faltered, losing her exact
sense of the words she used.</p>

<p>"Ah," the other flashed back, "then you <i>have</i> influence!
Why will you not use it?"</p>

<p>Justine waited a moment; then her resolve gathered
itself into words. "If I have any influence, I am not
sure it would be well to use it as you suggest."</p>

<p>"Not to urge Mr. Amherst's return?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not now."</p>

<p>She caught the same veiled gleam of incredulity under
Mrs. Ansell's lids&mdash;caught and disregarded it.</p>

<p>"It must be now or never," Mrs. Ansell insisted.</p>

<p>"I can't think so," Justine held out.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless&mdash;will you try?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! It might be fatal."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To both." She considered. "If he came back
now I know he would not stay."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell was upon her abruptly. "You <i>know</i>?
Then you speak with authority?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what authority? I speak as I feel," Justine
faltered.</p>

<p>The older woman drew herself to her feet. "Ah&mdash;then
you shoulder a great responsibility!" She moved
nearer to Justine, and once more laid a fugitive touch
upon her. "You won't write to him?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," the girl flung back; and the voices of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[p 364]</a></span>
returning party in the hall made Mrs. Ansell, with an
almost imperceptible gesture of warning, turn musingly
away toward the fire.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Bessy came back brimming with the wonders she had
seen. A glazed "sun-room," mosaic pavements, a
marble fountain to feed the marble tank&mdash;and outside
a water-garden, descending in successive terraces, to
take up and utilize&mdash;one could see how practically!&mdash;the
overflow from the tank. If one did the thing at all,
why not do it decently? She had given up her new
motor, had let her town house, had pinched and stinted
herself in a hundred ways&mdash;if ever woman was entitled
to a little compensating pleasure, surely she was that
woman!</p>

<p>The days were crowded with consultations. Architect,
contractors, engineers, a landscape gardener, and
a dozen minor craftsmen, came and went, unrolled
plans, moistened pencils, sketched, figured, argued,
persuaded, and filled Bessy with the dread of appearing,
under Blanche Carbury's eyes, subject to any restraining
influences of economy. What! She was a
young woman, with an independent fortune, and she
was always wavering, considering, secretly referring
back to the mute criticism of an invisible judge&mdash;of the
husband who had been first to shake himself free of
any mutual subjection? The accomplished Blanche<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[p 365]</a></span>
did not have to say this&mdash;she conveyed it by the raising
of painted brows, by a smile of mocking interrogation,
a judiciously placed silence or a resigned glance at the
architect. So the estimates poured in, were studied,
resisted&mdash;then yielded to and signed; then the hour of
advance payments struck, and an imperious appeal was
despatched to Mr. Tredegar, to whom the management
of Bessy's affairs had been transferred.</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar, to his client's surprise, answered the
appeal in person. He had not been lately to Lynbrook,
dreading the cold and damp of the country in winter; and
his sudden arrival had therefore an ominous significance.</p>

<p>He came for an evening in mid-week, when even
Blanche Carbury was absent, and Bessy and Justine
had the house to themselves. Mrs. Ansell had sailed
the week before with her invalid cousin. No farther
words had passed between herself and Justine&mdash;but the
latter was conscious that their talk had increased instead
of lessened the distance between them. Justine
herself meant to leave soon. Her hope of regaining
Bessy's confidence had been deceived, and seeing herself
definitely superseded, she chafed anew at her purposeless
inactivity. She had already written to one or
two doctors in New York, and to the matron of Saint
Elizabeth's. She had made herself a name in surgical
cases, and it could not be long before a summons
came....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[p 366]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Tredegar arrived, and the three dined
together, the two women bending meekly to his discourse,
which was never more oracular and authoritative
than when delivered to the gentler sex alone. Amherst's
absence, in particular, seemed to loose the thin
current of Mr. Tredegar's eloquence. He was never
quite at ease in the presence of an independent mind,
and Justine often reflected that, even had the two men
known nothing of each other's views, there would have
been between them an instinctive and irreducible hostility&mdash;they
would have disliked each other if they had
merely jostled elbows in the street.</p>

<p>Yet even freed from Amherst's presence Mr. Tredegar
showed a darkling brow, and as Justine slipped
away after dinner she felt that she left Bessy to something
more serious than the usual business conference.</p>

<p>How serious, she was to learn that very night, when,
in the small hours, her friend burst in on her tearfully.
Bessy was ruined&mdash;ruined&mdash;that was what Mr.
Tredegar had come to tell her! She might have
known he would not have travelled to Lynbrook for a
trifle.... She had expected to find herself cramped,
restricted&mdash;to be warned that she must "manage,"
hateful word!... But this! This was incredible!
Unendurable! There was no money to build the gymnasium&mdash;none
at all! And all because it had been
swallowed up at Westmore&mdash;because the ridiculous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[p 367]</a></span>
changes there, the changes that nobody wanted, nobody
approved of&mdash;that Truscomb and all the other experts
had opposed and derided from the first&mdash;these
changes, even modified and arrested, had already involved
so much of her income, that it might be years&mdash;yes,
he said <i>years</i>!&mdash;before she would feel herself free
again&mdash;free of her own fortune, of Cicely's fortune...of
the money poor Dick Westmore had meant his wife
and child to enjoy!</p>

<p>Justine listened anxiously to this confused outpouring
of resentments. Bessy's born incapacity for figures
made it indeed possible that the facts came on her as a
surprise&mdash;that she had quite forgotten the temporary
reduction of her income, and had begun to imagine
that what she had saved in one direction was hers to
spend in another. All this was conceivable. But why
had Mr. Tredegar drawn so dark a picture of the future?
Or was it only that, thwarted of her immediate desire,
Bessy's disappointment blackened the farthest verge of
her horizon? Justine, though aware of her friend's
lack of perspective, suspected that a conniving hand
had helped to throw the prospect out of drawing....</p>

<p>Could it be possible, then, that Mr. Tredegar was
among those who desired a divorce? That the influences
at which Mrs. Ansell had hinted proceeded not
only from Blanche Carbury and her group? Helpless
amid this rush of forebodings, Justine could do no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[p 368]</a></span>
more than soothe and restrain&mdash;to reason would have
been idle. She had never till now realized how completely
she had lost ground with Bessy.</p>

<p>"The humiliation&mdash;before my friends! Oh, I was
warned...my father, every one...for Cicely's sake
I was warned...but I wouldn't listen&mdash;and <i>now</i>!
From the first it was all he cared for&mdash;in Europe,
even, he was always dragging me to factories. <i>Me?</i>&mdash;I
was only the owner of Westmore! He wanted
power&mdash;power, that's all&mdash;when he lost it he left me...oh,
I'm glad now my baby is dead! Glad there's
nothing between us&mdash;nothing, nothing in the world to
tie us together any longer!"</p>

<p>The disproportion between this violent grief and its
trivial cause would have struck Justine as simply grotesque,
had she not understood that the incident of the
gymnasium, which followed with cumulative pressure
on a series of similar episodes, seemed to Bessy like the
reaching out of a retaliatory hand&mdash;a mocking reminder
that she was still imprisoned in the consequences of
her unhappy marriage.</p>

<p>Such folly seemed past weeping for&mdash;it froze Justine's
compassion into disdain, till she remembered
that the sources of our sorrow are sometimes nobler
than their means of expression, and that a baffled
unappeased love was perhaps the real cause of Bessy's
anger against her husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[p 369]</a></span></p>

<p>At any rate, the moment was a critical one, and Justine
remembered with a pang that Mrs. Ansell had
foreseen such a contingency, and implored her to take
measures against it. She had refused, from a sincere
dread of precipitating a definite estrangement&mdash;but
had she been right in judging the situation so logically?
With a creature of Bessy's emotional uncertainties the
result of contending influences was really incalculable&mdash;it
might still be that, at this juncture, Amherst's return
would bring about a reaction of better feelings....</p>

<p>Justine sat and mused on these things after leaving
her friend exhausted upon a tearful pillow. She
felt that she had perhaps taken too large a survey
of the situation&mdash;that the question whether there
could ever be happiness between this tormented pair
was not one to concern those who struggled for their
welfare. Most marriages are a patch-work of jarring
tastes and ill-assorted ambitions&mdash;if here and there,
for a moment, two colours blend, two textures are
the same, so much the better for the pattern! Justine,
certainly, could foresee in reunion no positive
happiness for either of her friends; but she saw positive
disaster for Bessy in separation from her husband....</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose from her chair by the falling fire,
and crossed over to the writing-table. She would write
to Amherst herself&mdash;she would tell him to come. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[p 370]</a></span>
decision once reached, hope flowed back to her heart&mdash;the
joy of action so often deceived her into immediate
faith in its results!</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Amherst," she wrote, "the last time I
saw you, you told me you would remember what I said.
I ask you to do so now&mdash;to remember that I urged you
not to be away too long. I believe you ought to come
back now, though I know Bessy will not ask you to. I
am writing without her knowledge, but with the conviction
that she needs you, though perhaps without
knowing it herself...."</p>

<p>She paused, and laid down her pen. Why did it
make her so happy to write to him? Was it merely
the sense of recovered helpfulness, or something warmer,
more personal, that made it a joy to trace his name,
and to remind him of their last intimate exchange of
words? Well&mdash;perhaps it was that too. There were
moments when she was so mortally lonely that any
sympathetic contact with another life sent a glow into
her veins&mdash;that she was thankful to warm herself at
any fire.</p>

<h2><a name="XXV" id="XXV"></a>XXV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bessy</span>, languidly glancing through her midday mail
some five days later, uttered a slight exclamation as
she withdrew her finger-tip from the flap of the envelope
she had begun to open.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[p 371]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a black sleety day, with an east wind bowing
the trees beyond the drenched window-panes, and the
two friends, after luncheon, had withdrawn to the
library, where Justine sat writing notes for Bessy, while
the latter lay back in her arm-chair, in the state of
dreamy listlessness into which she always sank when
not under the stimulus of amusement or exercise.</p>

<p>She sat suddenly upright as her eyes fell on the
letter.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon! I thought it was for me," she
said, holding it out to Justine.</p>

<p>The latter reddened as she glanced at the superscription.
It had not occurred to her that Amherst
would reply to her appeal: she had pictured him
springing on the first north-bound train, perhaps not
even pausing to announce his return to his wife....
And to receive his letter under Bessy's eye was undeniably
embarrassing, since Justine felt the necessity
of keeping her intervention secret.</p>

<p>But under Bessy's eye she certainly was&mdash;it continued
to rest on her curiously, speculatively, with an under-gleam
of malicious significance.</p>

<p>"So stupid of me&mdash;I can't imagine why I should have
expected my husband to write to me!" Bessy went on,
leaning back in lazy contemplation of her other letters,
but still obliquely including Justine in her angle of
vision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[p 372]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter, after a moment's pause, broke the seal
and read.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"Millfield, Georgia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear Miss Brent,</p>

<p>"Your letter reached me yesterday and I have
thought it over carefully. I appreciate the feeling that
prompted it&mdash;but I don't know that any friend, however
kind and discerning, can give the final advice in
such matters. You tell me you are sure my wife will
not ask me to return&mdash;well, under present conditions
that seems to me a sufficient reason for staying away.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I assure you that I have remembered
all you said to me that day. I have made no binding
arrangement here&mdash;nothing to involve my future action&mdash;and
I have done this solely because you asked it.
This will tell you better than words how much I value
your advice, and what strong reasons I must have for
not following it now.</p>

<p>"I suppose there are no more exploring parties in
this weather. I wish I could show Cicely some of the
birds down here.</p>

<p class="margin4">"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="margin5">"John Amherst.</p>


<p>"Please don't let my wife ride Impulse."</p></div>


<p>Latent under Justine's acute consciousness of what this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[p 373]</a></span>
letter meant, was the sense of Bessy's inferences and
conjectures. She could feel them actually piercing the
page in her hand like some hypersensitive visual organ
to which matter offers no obstruction. Or rather,
baffled in their endeavour, they were evoking out of
the unseen, heaven knew what fantastic structure of
intrigue&mdash;scrawling over the innocent page with burning
evidences of perfidy and collusion....</p>

<p>One thing became instantly clear to her: she must
show the letter to Bessy. She ran her eyes over it
again, trying to disentangle the consequences. There
was the allusion to their talk in town&mdash;well, she had
told Bessy of that! But the careless reference to their
woodland excursions&mdash;what might not Bessy, in her
present mood, make of it? Justine's uppermost thought
was of distress at the failure of her plan. Perhaps she
might still have induced Amherst to come back, had it
not been for this accident; but now that hope was
destroyed.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and met Bessy's. "Will you
read it?" she said, holding out the letter.</p>

<p>Bessy received it with lifted brows, and a protesting
murmur&mdash;but as she read, Justine saw the blood mount
under her clear skin, invade the temples, the nape, even
the little flower-like ears; then it receded as suddenly,
ebbing at last from the very lips, so that the smile
with which she looked up from her reading was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[p 374]</a></span>
white as if she had been under the stress of physical
pain.</p>

<p>"So you have written my husband to come back?"</p>

<p>"As you see."</p>

<p>Bessy looked her straight in the eyes. "I am very
much obliged to you&mdash;extremely obliged!"</p>

<p>Justine met the look quietly. "Which means that
you resent my interference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I leave you to call it that!" Bessy mocked,
tossing the letter down on the table at her side.</p>

<p>"Bessy! Don't take it in that way. If I made a
mistake I did so with the hope of helping you. How can
I stand by, after all these months together, and see you deliberately
destroying your life without trying to stop you?"</p>

<p>The smile withered on Bessy's lips. "It is very dear
and good of you&mdash;I know you're never happy unless
you're helping people&mdash;but in this case I can only
repeat what my husband says. He and I don't often
look at things in the same light&mdash;but I quite agree with
him that the management of such matters is best left
to&mdash;to the persons concerned."</p>

<p>Justine hesitated. "I might answer that, if you take
that view, it was inconsistent of you to talk with me
so openly. You've certainly made me feel that you
wanted help&mdash;you've turned to me for it. But perhaps
that does not justify my writing to Mr. Amherst without
your knowing it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[p 375]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessy laughed. "Ah, my dear, you knew that if you
asked me the letter would never be sent!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did," said Justine simply. "I was trying
to help you against your will."</p>

<p>"Well, you see the result." Bessy laid a derisive
touch on the letter. "Do you understand now whose
fault it is if I am alone?"</p>

<p>Justine faced her steadily. "There is nothing in
Mr. Amherst's letter to make me change my opinion.
I still think it lies with you to bring him back."</p>

<p>Bessy raised a glittering face to her&mdash;all hardness and
laughter. "Such modesty, my dear! As if I had a
chance of succeeding where you failed!"</p>

<p>She sprang up, brushing the curls from her temples
with a petulant gesture. "Don't mind me if I'm cross&mdash;but
I've had a dose of preaching from Maria Ansell,
and I don't know why my friends should treat me like
a puppet without any preferences of my own, and
press me upon a man who has done his best to show
that he doesn't want me. As a matter of fact, he and
I are luckily agreed on that point too&mdash;and I'm afraid
all the good advice in the world won't persuade us to
change our opinion!"</p>

<p>Justine held her ground. "If I believed that of
either of you, I shouldn't have written&mdash;I should not
be pleading with you now&mdash;And Mr. Amherst
doesn't believe it either," she added, after a pause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[p 376]</a></span>
conscious of the risk she was taking, but thinking the
words might act like a blow in the face of a person
sinking under a deadly narcotic.</p>

<p>Bessy's smile deepened to a sneer. "I see you've
talked me over thoroughly&mdash;and on <i>his</i> views I ought
perhaps not to have risked an opinion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have not talked you over," Justine exclaimed.
"Mr. Amherst could never talk of you...in the way
you think...." And under the light staccato of Bessy's
laugh she found resolution to add: "It is not in that
way that I know what he feels."</p>

<p>"Ah? I should be curious to hear, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Justine turned to the letter, which still lay between
them. "Will you read the last sentence again? The
postscript, I mean."</p>

<p>Bessy, after a surprised glance at her, took the letter
up with the deprecating murmur of one who acts under
compulsion rather than dispute about a trifle.</p>

<p>"The postscript? Let me see...'Don't let my
wife ride Impulse.'&mdash;<i>Et puis?</i>" she murmured, dropping
the page again.</p>

<p>"Well, does it tell you nothing? It's a cold letter&mdash;at
first I thought so&mdash;the letter of a man who believes
himself deeply hurt&mdash;so deeply that he will make no
advance, no sign of relenting. That's what I thought
when I first read it...but the postscript undoes
it all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[p 377]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine, as she spoke, had drawn near Bessy, laying
a hand on her arm, and shedding on her the radiance
of a face all charity and sweet compassion. It was
her rare gift, at such moments, to forget her own relation
to the person for whose fate she was concerned,
to cast aside all consciousness of criticism and distrust
in the heart she strove to reach, as pitiful people forget
their physical timidity in the attempt to help a wounded
animal.</p>

<p>For a moment Bessy seemed to waver. The colour
flickered faintly up her cheek, her long lashes drooped&mdash;she
had the tenderest lids!&mdash;and all her face seemed
melting under the beams of Justine's ardour. But
the letter was still in her hand&mdash;her eyes, in sinking,
fell upon it, and she sounded beneath her breath the
fatal phrase: "'I have done this solely because you
asked it.'</p>

<p>"After such a tribute to your influence I don't wonder
you feel competent to set everybody's affairs in
order! But take my advice, my dear&mdash;<i>don't</i> ask me
not to ride Impulse!"</p>

<p>The pity froze on Justine's lip: she shrank back cut
to the quick. For a moment the silence between the
two women rang with the flight of arrowy, wounding
thoughts; then Bessy's anger flagged, she gave one of
her embarrassed half-laughs, and turning back, laid a
deprecating touch on her friend's arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[p 378]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, Justine...but let us not talk
now&mdash;I can't!"</p>

<p>Justine did not move: the reaction could not come
as quickly in her case. But she turned on Bessy
two eyes full of pardon, full of speechless pity...and
Bessy received the look silently before she moved
to the door and went out.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor thing&mdash;poor thing!" Justine gasped as
the door closed.</p>

<p>She had already forgotten her own hurt&mdash;she was
alone again with Bessy's sterile pain. She stood
staring before her for a moment&mdash;then her eyes fell on
Amherst's letter, which had fluttered to the floor between
them. The fatal letter! If it had not come at
that unlucky moment perhaps she might still have
gained her end.... She picked it up and re-read it.
Yes&mdash;there were phrases in it that a wounded suspicious
heart might misconstrue.... Yet Bessy's last
words had absolved her.... Why had she not answered
them? Why had she stood there dumb? The blow
to her pride had been too deep, had been dealt too
unexpectedly&mdash;for one miserable moment she had
thought first of herself! Ah, that importunate, irrepressible
self&mdash;the <i>moi ha&iuml;ssable</i> of the Christian&mdash;if
only one could tear it from one's breast! She had
missed an opportunity&mdash;her last opportunity perhaps!
By this time, even, a hundred hostile influences, cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[p 379]</a></span>
whispers of vanity, of selfishness, of worldly pride,
might have drawn their freezing ring about Bessy's
heart....</p>

<p>Justine started up to follow her...then paused, recalling
her last words. "Let us not talk now&mdash;I can't!"
She had no right to intrude on that bleeding privacy&mdash;if
the chance had been hers she had lost it. She
dropped back into her seat at the desk, hiding her face
in her hands.</p>

<p>Presently she heard the clock strike, and true to her
tireless instinct of activity, she lifted her head, took up
her pen, and went on with the correspondence she had
dropped.... It was hard at first to collect her thoughts,
or even to summon to her pen the conventional phrases
that sufficed for most of the notes. Groping for a
word, she pushed aside her writing and stared out at
the sallow frozen landscape framed by the window at
which she sat. The sleet had ceased, and hollows of
sunless blue showed through the driving wind-clouds.
A hard sky and a hard ground&mdash;frost-bound ringing
earth under rigid ice-mailed trees.</p>

<p>As Justine looked out, shivering a little, she saw a
woman's figure riding down the avenue toward the gate.
The figure disappeared behind a clump of evergreens&mdash;showed
again farther down, through the boughs of
a skeleton beech&mdash;and revealed itself in the next open
space as Bessy&mdash;Bessy in the saddle on a day of glaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[p 380]</a></span>
frost, when no horse could keep his footing out of a
walk!</p>

<p>Justine went to the window and strained her eyes
for a confirming glimpse. Yes&mdash;it was Bessy! There
was no mistaking that light flexible figure, every line
swaying true to the beat of the horse's stride. But
Justine remembered that Bessy had not meant to ride&mdash;had
countermanded her horse because of the bad
going.... Well, she was a perfect horsewoman and had
no doubt chosen her surest-footed mount...probably
the brown cob, Tony Lumpkin.</p>

<p>But when did Tony's sides shine so bright through
the leafless branches? And when did he sweep his
rider on with such long free play of the hind-quarters?
Horse and rider shot into sight again, rounding the
curve of the avenue near the gates, and in a break of
sunlight Justine saw the glitter of chestnut flanks&mdash;and
remembered that Impulse was the only chestnut in
the stables....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>She went back to her seat and continued writing.
Bessy had left a formidable heap of bills and letters;
and when this was demolished, Justine had her own
correspondence to despatch. She had heard that morning
from the matron of Saint Elizabeth's: an interesting
"case" was offered her, but she must come within
two days. For the first few hours she had wavered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[p 381]</a></span>
loath to leave Lynbrook without some definite light on
her friend's future; but now Amherst's letter had shed
that light&mdash;or rather, had deepened the obscurity&mdash;and
she had no pretext for lingering on where her uselessness
had been so amply demonstrated.</p>

<p>She wrote to the matron accepting the engagement;
and the acceptance involved the writing of other letters,
the general reorganizing of that minute polity, the life
of Justine Brent. She smiled a little to think how
easily she could be displaced and transplanted&mdash;how
slender were her material impedimenta, how few her
invisible bonds! She was as light and detachable as
a dead leaf on the autumn breeze&mdash;yet she was in the
season of sap and flower, when there is life and song
in the trees!</p>

<p>But she did not think long of herself, for an undefinable
anxiety ran through her thoughts like a black
thread. It found expression, now and then, in the long
glances she threw through the window&mdash;in her rising
to consult the clock and compare her watch with it&mdash;in
a nervous snatch of humming as she paced the room
once or twice before going back to her desk....</p>

<p>Why was Bessy so late? Dusk was falling already&mdash;the
early end of the cold slate-hued day. But Bessy
always rode late&mdash;there was always a rational answer
to Justine's irrational conjectures.... It was the sight
of those chestnut flanks that tormented her&mdash;she knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[p 382]</a></span>
of Bessy's previous struggles with the mare. But the
indulging of idle apprehensions was not in her nature,
and when the tea-tray came, and with it Cicely, sparkling
from a gusty walk, and coral-pink in her cloud of
crinkled hair, Justine sprang up and cast off her cares.</p>

<p>It cost her a pang, again, to see the lamps lit and
the curtains drawn&mdash;shutting in the warmth and
brightness of the house from that wind-swept frozen
twilight through which Bessy rode alone. But the icy
touch of the thought slipped from Justine's mind as
she bent above the tea-tray, gravely measuring Cicely's
milk into a "grown-up" teacup, hearing the confidential
details of the child's day, and capping them with
banter and fantastic narrative.</p>

<p>She was not sorry to go&mdash;ah, no! The house had
become a prison to her, with ghosts walking its dreary
floors. But to lose Cicely would be bitter&mdash;she had not
felt how bitter till the child pressed against her in the
firelight, insisting raptly, with little sharp elbows stabbing
her knee: "And <i>then</i> what happened, Justine?"</p>

<p>The door opened, and some one came in to look at
the fire. Justine, through the mazes of her fairy-tale,
was dimly conscious that it was Knowles, and not one
of the footmen...the proud Knowles, who never
mended the fires himself.... As he passed out again,
hovering slowly down the long room, she rose, leaving
Cicely on the hearth-rug, and followed him to the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[p 383]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has Mrs. Amherst not come in?" she asked, not
knowing why she wished to ask it out of the child's
hearing.</p>

<p>"No, miss. I looked in myself to see&mdash;thinking she
might have come by the side-door."</p>

<p>"She may have gone to her sitting-room."</p>

<p>"She's not upstairs."</p>

<p>They both paused. Then Justine said: "What
horse was she riding?"</p>

<p>"Impulse, Miss." The butler looked at his large
responsible watch. "It's not late&mdash;" he said, more to
himself than to her.</p>

<p>"No. Has she been riding Impulse lately?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss. Not since that day the mare nearly had
her off. I understood Mr. Amherst did not wish it."</p>

<p>Justine went back to Cicely and the fairy-tale.&mdash;As
she took up the thread of the Princess's adventures, she
asked herself why she had ever had any hope of helping
Bessy. The seeds of disaster were in the poor
creature's soul.... Even when she appeared to be
moved, lifted out of herself, her escaping impulses were
always dragged back to the magnetic centre of hard
distrust and resistance that sometimes forms the core
of soft-fibred natures. As she had answered her husband's
previous appeal by her flight to the woman he
disliked, so she answered this one by riding the horse
he feared.... Justine's last illusions crumbled. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[p 384]</a></span>
distance between two such natures was unspannable.
Amherst had done well to remain away...and with
a tidal rush her sympathies swept back to his side....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The governess came to claim Cicely. One of the footmen
came to put another log on the fire. Then the
rite of removing the tea-table was majestically performed&mdash;the
ceremonial that had so often jarred on
Amherst's nerves. As she watched it, Justine had a
vague sense of the immutability of the household
routine&mdash;a queer awed feeling that, whatever happened,
a machine so perfectly adjusted would work
on inexorably, like a natural law....</p>

<p>She rose to look out of the window, staring vainly
into blackness between the parted curtains. As she
turned back, passing the writing-table, she noticed
that Cicely's irruption had made her forget to post her
letters&mdash;an unusual oversight. A glance at the clock
told her that she was not too late for the mail&mdash;reminding
her, at the same time, that it was scarcely
three hours since Bessy had started on her ride....
She saw the foolishness of her fears. Even in winter,
Bessy often rode for more than three hours; and now
that the days were growing longer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly reassured, Justine went out into the hall,
intending to carry her batch of letters to the red pillar-box
by the door. As she did so, a cold blast struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[p 385]</a></span>
her. Could it be that for once the faultless routine of
the house had been relaxed, that one of the servants
had left the outer door ajar? She walked over to the
vestibule&mdash;yes, both doors were wide. The night
rushed in on a vicious wind. As she pushed the
vestibule door shut, she heard the dogs sniffing and
whining on the threshold. She crossed the vestibule,
and heard voices and the tramping of feet in the darkness&mdash;then
saw a lantern gleam. Suddenly Knowles
shot out of the night&mdash;the lantern struck on his
bleached face.</p>

<p>Justine, stepping back, pressed the electric button
in the wall, and the wide door-step was abruptly illuminated,
with its huddled, pushing, heavily-breathing
group...black figures writhing out of darkness,
strange faces distorted in the glare.</p>

<p>"Bessy!" she cried, and sprang forward; but suddenly
Wyant was before her, his hand on her arm;
and as the dreadful group struggled by into the hall,
he froze her to him with a whisper: "The spine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI"></a>XXVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> Justine there was a moment's darkness;
then, like terror-struck workers rallying to their
tasks, every faculty was again at its post, receiving
and transmitting signals, taking observations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[p 386]</a></span>
anticipating orders, making her brain ring with the
hum of a controlled activity.</p>

<p>She had known the sensation before&mdash;the transmuting
of terror and pity into this miraculous lucidity of
thought and action; but never had it snatched her
from such depths. Oh, thank heaven for her knowledge
now&mdash;for the trained mind that could take command
of her senses and bend them firmly to its service!</p>

<p>Wyant seconded her well, after a moment's ague-fit
of fear. She pitied and pardoned the moment, aware
of its cause, and respecting him for the way in which
he rose above it into the clear air of professional self-command.
Through the first hours they worked
shoulder to shoulder, conscious of each other only as
of kindred will-powers, stretched to the utmost tension
of discernment and activity, and hardly needing speech
or look to further their swift co-operation. It was thus
that she had known him in the hospital, in the heat of
his youthful zeal: the doctor she liked best to work
with, because no other so tempered ardour with judgment.</p>

<p>The great surgeon, arriving from town at midnight,
confirmed his diagnosis: there was undoubted injury
to the spine. Other consultants were summoned in
haste, and in the winter dawn the verdict was pronounced&mdash;a
fractured vertebra, and possibly lesion of
the cord....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[p 387]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine got a moment alone when the surgeons returned
to the sick-room. Other nurses were there now,
capped, aproned, quickly and silently unpacking their
appliances.... She must call a halt, clear her brain
again, decide rapidly what was to be done next....
Oh, if only the crawling hours could bring Amherst!
It was strange that there was no telegram yet&mdash;no, not
strange, after all, since it was barely six in the morning,
and her message had not been despatched till seven
the night before. It was not unlikely that, in that
little southern settlement, the telegraph office closed at
six.</p>

<p>She stood in Bessy's sitting-room, her forehead
pressed to the window-pane, her eyes straining out into
the thin February darkness, through which the morning
star swam white. As soon as she had yielded her
place to the other nurses her nervous tension relaxed,
and she hung again above the deeps of anguish, terrified
and weak. In a moment the necessity for action
would snatch her back to a firm footing&mdash;her thoughts
would clear, her will affirm itself, all the wheels of the
complex machine resume their functions. But now
she felt only the horror....</p>

<p>She knew so well what was going on in the next room.
Dr. Garford, the great surgeon, who had known her at
Saint Elizabeth's, had evidently expected her to take
command of the nurses he had brought from town;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[p 388]</a></span>
but there were enough without her, and there were
other cares which, for the moment, she only could
assume&mdash;the despatching of messages to the scattered
family, the incessant telephoning and telegraphing to
town, the general guidance of the household swinging
rudderless in the tide of disaster. Cicely, above all,
must be watched over and guarded from alarm. The
little governess, reduced to a twittering heap of fears,
had been quarantined in a distant room till reason returned
to her; and the child, meanwhile, slept quietly
in the old nurse's care.</p>

<p>Cicely would wake presently, and Justine must go
up to her with a bright face; other duties would press
thick on the heels of this; their feet were already on
the threshold. But meanwhile she could only follow
in imagination what was going on in the other
room....</p>

<p>She had often thought with dread of such a contingency.
She always sympathized too much with her
patients&mdash;she knew it was the joint in her armour.
Her quick-gushing pity lay too near that professional
exterior which she had managed to endue with such a
bright glaze of insensibility that some sentimental
patients&mdash;without much the matter&mdash;had been known
to call her "a little hard." How, then, should she
steel herself if it fell to her lot to witness a cruel accident
to some one she loved, and to have to perform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[p 389]</a></span>
a nurse's duties, steadily, expertly, unflinchingly, while
every fibre was torn with inward anguish?</p>

<p>She knew the horror of it now&mdash;and she knew also
that her self-enforced exile from the sick-room was a
hundred times worse. To stand there, knowing, with
each tick of the clock, what was being said and done
within&mdash;how the great luxurious room, with its pale
draperies and scented cushions, and the hundred pretty
trifles strewing the lace toilet-table and the delicate old
furniture, was being swept bare, cleared for action like
a ship's deck, drearily garnished with rows of instruments,
rolls of medicated cotton, oiled silk, bottles,
bandages, water-pillows&mdash;all the grim paraphernalia
of the awful rites of pain: to know this, and to be able
to call up with torturing vividness that poor pale face
on the pillows, vague-eyed, expressionless, perhaps, as
she had last seen it, or&mdash;worse yet&mdash;stirred already with
the first creeping pangs of consciousness: to have these
images slowly, deliberately burn themselves into her
brain, and to be aware, at the same time, of that underlying
moral disaster, of which the accident seemed the
monstrous outward symbol&mdash;ah, this was worse than
anything she had ever dreamed!</p>

<p>She knew that the final verdict could not be pronounced
till the operation which was about to take
place should reveal the extent of injury to the spine.
Bessy, in falling, must have struck on the back of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[p 390]</a></span>
head and shoulders, and it was but too probable that
the fractured vertebra had caused a bruise if not a lesion
of the spinal cord. In that case paralysis was certain&mdash;and
a slow crawling death the almost inevitable outcome.
There had been cases, of course&mdash;Justine's professional
memory evoked them&mdash;cases of so-called "recovery,"
where actual death was kept at bay, a semblance
of life preserved for years in the poor petrified
body.... But the mind shrank from such a fate for
Bessy. And it might still be that the injury to the
spine was not grave&mdash;though, here again, the fracturing
of the fourth vertebra was ominous.</p>

<p>The door opened and some one came from the inner
room&mdash;Wyant, in search of an instrument-case. Justine
turned and they looked at each other.</p>

<p>"It will be now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dr. Garford asked if there was no one you
could send for."</p>

<p>"No one but Mr. Tredegar and the Halford Gaineses.
They'll be here this evening, I suppose."</p>

<p>They exchanged a discouraged glance, knowing how
little difference the presence of the Halford Gaineses
would make.</p>

<p>"He wanted to know if there was no telegram from
Amherst."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then they mean to begin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[p 391]</a></span></p>

<p>A nursemaid appeared in the doorway. "Miss
Cicely&mdash;" she said; and Justine bounded upstairs.</p>

<p>The day's work had begun. From Cicely to the governess&mdash;from
the governess to the housekeeper&mdash;from
the telephone to the writing-table&mdash;Justine vibrated
back and forth, quick, noiseless, self-possessed&mdash;sobering,
guiding, controlling her confused and panic-stricken
world. It seemed to her that half the day had
elapsed before the telegraph office at Lynbrook opened&mdash;she
was at the telephone at the stroke of the hour.
No telegram? Only one&mdash;a message from Halford
Gaines&mdash;"Arrive at eight tonight." Amherst was still
silent! Was there a difference of time to be allowed
for? She tried to remember, to calculate, but her
brain was too crowded with other thoughts.... She
turned away from the instrument discouraged.</p>

<p>Whenever she had time to think, she was overwhelmed
by the weight of her solitude. Mr. Langhope
was in Egypt, accessible only through a London banker&mdash;Mrs.
Ansell presumably wandering on the continent.
Her cables might not reach them for days. And among
the throng of Lynbrook habitu&eacute;s, she knew not to whom
to turn. To loose the Telfer tribe and Mrs. Carbury
upon that stricken house&mdash;her thought revolted from
it, and she was thankful to know that February had
dispersed their migratory flock to southern shores.
But if only Amherst would come!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[p 392]</a></span></p>

<p>Cicely and the tranquillized governess had been despatched
on a walk with the dogs, and Justine was
returning upstairs when she met one of the servants
with a telegram. She tore it open with a great throb
of relief. It was her own message to Amherst&mdash;<i>address
unknown</i>....</p>

<p>Had she misdirected it, then? In that first blinding
moment her mind might so easily have failed her. But
no&mdash;there was the name of the town before her...Millfield,
Georgia...the same name as in his letter....
She had made no mistake, but he was gone! Gone&mdash;and
without leaving an address.... For a moment her
tired mind refused to work; then she roused herself,
ran down the stairs again, and rang up the telegraph-office.
The thing to do, of course, was to telegraph
to the owner of the mills&mdash;of whose very name she was
ignorant!&mdash;enquiring where Amherst was, and asking
him to forward the message. Precious hours must be
lost meanwhile&mdash;but, after all, they were waiting for
no one upstairs.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The verdict had been pronounced: dislocation and
fracture of the fourth vertebra, with consequent injury
to the spinal cord. Dr. Garford and Wyant came out
alone to tell her. The surgeon ran over the technical
details, her brain instantly at attention as he developed
his diagnosis and issued his orders. She asked no ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[p 393]</a></span>tions
as to the future&mdash;she knew it was impossible to
tell. But there were no immediate signs of a fatal
ending: the patient had rallied well, and the general
conditions were not unfavourable.</p>

<p>"You have heard from Mr. Amherst?" Dr. Garford
concluded.</p>

<p>"Not yet...he may be travelling," Justine faltered,
unwilling to say that her telegram had been returned.
As she spoke there was a tap on the door,
and a folded paper was handed in&mdash;a telegram telephoned
from the village.</p>

<p>"Amherst gone South America to study possibilities
cotton growing have cabled our correspondent Buenos
Ayres."</p>

<p>Concealment was no longer possible. Justine
handed the message to the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;and there would be no chance of finding his
address among Mrs. Amherst's papers?"</p>

<p>"I think not&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we must keep her alive, Wyant."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At dusk, Justine sat in the library, waiting for Cicely
to be brought to her. A lull had descended on the
house&mdash;a new order developed out of the morning's
chaos. With soundless steps, with lowered voices, the
machinery of life was carried on. And Justine, caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[p 394]</a></span>
in one of the pauses of inaction which she had fought
off since morning, was reliving, for the hundredth time,
her few moments at Bessy's bedside....</p>

<p>She had been summoned in the course of the afternoon,
and stealing into the darkened room, had bent
over the bed while the nurses noiselessly withdrew.
There lay the white face which had been burnt into
her inward vision&mdash;the motionless body, and the head
stirring ceaselessly, as though to release the agitation
of the imprisoned limbs. Bessy's eyes turned to her,
drawing her down.</p>

<p>"Am I going to die, Justine?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The pain is...so awful...."</p>

<p>"It will pass...you will sleep...."</p>

<p>"Cicely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She has gone for a walk. You'll see her presently."</p>

<p>The eyes faded, releasing Justine. She stole away,
and the nurses came back.</p>

<p>Bessy had spoken of Cicely&mdash;but not a word of her
husband! Perhaps her poor dazed mind groped for
him, or perhaps it shrank from his name.... Justine
was thankful for her silence. For the moment her
heart was bitter against Amherst. Why, so soon after
her appeal and his answer, had he been false to the
spirit of their agreement? This unannounced, unex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[p 395]</a></span>plained
departure was nothing less than a breach of
his tacit pledge&mdash;the pledge not to break definitely with
Lynbrook. And why had he gone to South America?
She drew her aching brows together, trying to retrace
a vague memory of some allusion to the cotton-growing
capabilities of the region.... Yes, he had spoken of it
once in talking of the world's area of cotton production.
But what impulse had sent him off on such an exploration?
Mere unrest, perhaps&mdash;the intolerable burden
of his useless life? The questions spun round and
round in her head, weary, profitless, yet persistent....</p>

<p>It was a relief when Cicely came&mdash;a relief to measure
out the cambric tea, to make the terrier beg for ginger-bread,
even to take up the thread of the interrupted
fairy-tale&mdash;though through it all she was wrung by the
thought that, just twenty-four hours earlier, she and
the child had sat in the same place, listening for the
trot of Bessy's horse....</p>

<p>The day passed: the hands of the clocks moved,
food was cooked and served, blinds were drawn up or
down, lamps lit and fires renewed...all these tokens
of the passage of time took place before her, while her
real consciousness seemed to hang in some dim central
void, where nothing happened, nothing would ever
happen....</p>

<p>And now Cicely was in bed, the last "long-distance"
call was answered, the last orders to kitchen and stable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[p 396]</a></span>
had been despatched, Wyant had stolen down to her
with his hourly report&mdash;"no change"&mdash;and she was
waiting in the library for the Gaineses.</p>

<p>Carriage-wheels on the gravel: they were there at
last. Justine started up and went into the hall.
As she passed out of the library the outer door
opened, and the gusty night swooped in&mdash;as, at the
same hour the day before, it had swooped in ahead of
the dreadful procession&mdash;preceding now the carriageful
of Hanaford relations: Mr. Gaines, red-glazed, brief
and interrogatory; Westy, small, nervous, ill at ease
with his grief; and Mrs. Gaines, supreme in the possession
of a consolatory yet funereal manner, and sinking
on Justine's breast with the solemn whisper: "Have
you sent for the clergyman?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXVII" id="XXVII"></a>XXVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> house was empty again.</p>

<p>A week had passed since Bessy's accident, and
friends and relations had dispersed. The household
had fallen into its routine, the routine of sickness and
silence, and once more the perfectly-adjusted machine
was working on steadily, inexorably, like a natural
law....</p>

<p>So at least it seemed to Justine's nerves, intolerably
stretched, at times, on the rack of solitude, of suspense,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[p 397]</a></span>
of forebodings. She had been thankful when the
Gaineses left&mdash;doubly thankful when a telegram from
Bermuda declared Mrs. Carbury to be "in despair" at
her inability to fly to Bessy's side&mdash;thankful even that
Mr. Tredegar's professional engagements made it impossible
for him to do more than come down, every
second or third day, for a few hours; yet, though in
some ways it was a relief to be again in sole command,
there were moments when the weight of responsibility,
and the inability to cry out her fears and her uncertainties,
seemed almost unendurable.</p>

<p>Wyant was her chief reliance. He had risen so gallantly
above his weakness, become again so completely
the indefatigable worker of former days, that she
accused herself of injustice in ascribing to physical
causes the vague eye and tremulous hand which might
merely have betokened a passing access of nervous
sensibility. Now, at any rate, he had his nerves so
well under control, and had shown such a grasp of the
case, and such marked executive capacity, that on the
third day after the accident Dr. Garford, withdrawing
his own assistant, had left him in control at Lynbrook.</p>

<p>At the same time Justine had taken up her attendance
in the sick-room, replacing one of the subordinate
nurses who had been suddenly called away. She had
done this the more willingly because Bessy, who was
now conscious for the greater part of the time, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[p 398]</a></span>
asked for her once or twice, and had seemed easier
when she was in the room. But she still gave only
occasional aid, relieving the other nurses when they
dined or rested, but keeping herself partly free in order
to have an eye on the household, and give a few hours
daily to Cicely.</p>

<p>All this had become part of a system that already
seemed as old as memory. She could hardly recall
what life had been before the accident&mdash;the seven
dreadful days seemed as long as the days of creation.
Every morning she rose to the same report&mdash;"no
change"&mdash;and every day passed without a word from
Amherst. Minor news, of course, had come: poor Mr.
Langhope, at length overtaken at Wady Halfa, was
hastening back as fast as ship and rail could carry him;
Mrs. Ansell, anchored at Algiers with her invalid, cabled
anxious enquiries; but still no word from Amherst.
The correspondent at Buenos Ayres had simply cabled
"Not here. Will enquire"&mdash;and since then, silence.</p>

<p>Justine had taken to sitting in a small room beyond
Amherst's bedroom, near enough to Bessy to be within
call, yet accessible to the rest of the household. The
walls were hung with old prints, and with two or three
photographs of early Italian pictures; and in a low
bookcase Amherst had put the books he had brought
from Hanaford&mdash;the English poets, the Greek dramatists,
some text-books of biology and kindred sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[p 399]</a></span>jects,
and a few stray well-worn volumes: Lecky's
European Morals, Carlyle's translation of Wilhelm
Meister, Seneca, Epictetus, a German grammar, a
pocket Bacon.</p>

<p>It was unlike any other room at Lynbrook&mdash;even
through her benumbing misery, Justine felt the relief of
escaping there from the rest of the great soulless house.
Sometimes she took up one of the books and read a
page or two, letting the beat of the verse lull her throbbing
brain, or the strong words of stoic wisdom sink
into her heart. And even when there was no time for
these brief flights from reality, it soothed her to feel
herself in the presence of great thoughts&mdash;to know that
in this room, among these books, another restless
baffled mind had sought escape from the "dusty answer"
of life. Her hours there made her think less
bitterly of Amherst&mdash;but also, alas, made her see more
clearly the irreconcilable difference between the two
natures she had striven to reunite. That which was
the essence of life to one was a meaningless shadow to
the other; and the gulf between them was too wide for
the imagination of either to bridge.</p>

<p>As she sat there on the seventh afternoon there was
a knock on the door and Wyant entered. She had
only time to notice that he was very pale&mdash;she had been
struck once or twice with his look of sudden exhaustion,
which passed as quickly as it came&mdash;then she saw that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[p 400]</a></span>
he carried a telegram, and her mind flew back to its
central anxiety. She grew pale herself as she read the
message.</p>

<p>"He has been found&mdash;at Corrientes. It will take
him at least a month to get here."</p>

<p>"A month&mdash;good God!"</p>

<p>"And it may take Mr. Langhope longer." Their
eyes met. "It's too long&mdash;&mdash;?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't know." He shivered slightly,
turning away into the window.</p>

<p>Justine sat down to dash off messages to Mr. Tredegar
and the Gaineses: Amherst's return must be made
known at once. When she glanced up, Wyant was
standing near her. His air of intense weariness had
passed, and he looked calm and ready for action.</p>

<p>"Shall I take these down?"</p>

<p>"No. Ring, please. I want to ask you a few
questions."</p>

<p>The servant who answered the bell brought in a tea-tray,
and Justine, having despatched the telegrams,
seated herself and began to pour out her tea. Food
had been repugnant to her during the first anguished
unsettled days, but with the resumption of the nurse's
systematic habits the nurse's punctual appetite returned.
Every drop of energy must be husbanded
now, and only sleep and nourishment could fill the
empty cisterns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[p 401]</a></span></p>

<p>She held out a cup to Wyant, but he drew back
with a gesture of aversion.</p>

<p>"Thanks; I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>"You ought to eat more."</p>

<p>"No, no. I'm very well."</p>

<p>She lifted her head, revived by the warm draught.
The mechanical act of nourishment performed, her
mind leapt back to the prospect of Amherst's return.
A whole month before he reached Lynbrook! He had
instructed her where news might find him on the
way...but a whole month to wait!</p>

<p>She looked at Wyant, and they read each other's
thoughts.</p>

<p>"It's a long time," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But Garford can do wonders&mdash;and she's very
strong."</p>

<p>Justine shuddered. Just so a skilled agent of the
Inquisition might have spoken, calculating how much
longer the power of suffering might be artificially preserved
in a body broken on the wheel....</p>

<p>"How does she seem to you today?"</p>

<p>"The general conditions are about the same. The
heart keeps up wonderfully, but there is a little more
oppression of the diaphragm."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;her breathing is harder. Last night she suffered
horribly at times."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[p 402]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;she'll suffer," Wyant murmured. "Of course
the hypodermics can be increased."</p>

<p>"Just what did Dr. Garford say this morning?"</p>

<p>"He is astonished at her strength."</p>

<p>"But there's no hope?&mdash;I don't know why I ask!"</p>

<p>"Hope?" Wyant looked at her. "You mean of
what's called recovery&mdash;of deferring death indefinitely?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"How can Garford tell&mdash;or any one? We all know
there have been cases where such injury to the cord
has not caused death. This may be one of those cases;
but the biggest man couldn't say now."</p>

<p>Justine hid her eyes. "What a fate!"</p>

<p>"Recovery? Yes. Keeping people alive in such
cases is one of the refinements of cruelty that it was
left for Christianity to invent."</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;it's got to be! Science herself says so&mdash;not
for the patient, of course; but for herself&mdash;for unborn
generations, rather. Queer, isn't it? The two
creeds are at one."</p>

<p>Justine murmured through her clasped hands: "I
wish she were not so strong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's wonderful what those frail petted bodies
can stand. The fight is going to be a hard one."</p>

<p>She rose with a shiver. "I must go to Cicely&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[p 403]</a></span>
The rector of Saint Anne's had called again. Justine,
in obedience to Mrs. Gaines's suggestion, had summoned
him from Clifton the day after the accident;
but, supported by the surgeons and Wyant, she had
resisted his admission to the sick-room. Bessy's religious
practices had been purely mechanical: her
faith had never been associated with the graver moments
of her life, and the apparition of a clerical figure
at her bedside would portend not consolation but
calamity. Since it was all-important that her nervous
strength should be sustained, and the gravity of the
situation kept from her, Mrs. Gaines yielded to
the medical commands, consoled by the ready acquiescence
of the rector. But before she left she extracted
a promise that he would call frequently at Lynbrook,
and wait his opportunity to say an uplifting word to
Mrs. Amherst.</p>

<p>The Reverend Ernest Lynde, who was a young man,
with more zeal than experience, deemed it his duty to
obey this injunction to the letter; but hitherto he had
had to content himself with a talk with the housekeeper,
or a brief word on the doorstep from Wyant. Today,
however, he had asked somewhat insistently for Miss
Brent; and Justine, who was free at the moment, felt
that she could not refuse to go down. She had seen
him only in the pulpit, when once or twice, in Bessy's
absence, she had taken Cicely to church: he struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[p 404]</a></span>
her as a grave young man, with a fine voice
but halting speech. His sermons were earnest but
ineffective.</p>

<p>As he rose to meet her, she felt that she should like
him better out of church. His glance was clear and
honest, and there was sweetness in his hesitating smile.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to seem persistent&mdash;but I heard you had
news of Mr. Langhope, and I was anxious to know the
particulars," he explained.</p>

<p>Justine replied that her message had overtaken Mr.
Langhope at Wady Haifa, and that he hoped to reach
Alexandria in time to catch a steamer to Brindisi at
the end of the week.</p>

<p>"Not till then? So it will be almost three weeks&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can calculate, a month."</p>

<p>The rector hesitated. "And Mr. Amherst?"</p>

<p>"He is coming back too."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have heard? I'm glad of that. He will
be here soon?"</p>

<p>"No. He is in South America&mdash;at Buenos Ayres.
There will be no steamer for some days, and he may
not get here till after Mr. Langhope."</p>

<p>Mr. Lynde looked at her kindly, with grave eyes
that proffered help. "This is terrible for you, Miss
Brent."</p>

<p>"Yes," Justine answered simply.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Amherst's condition&mdash;&mdash;?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[p 405]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is about the same."</p>

<p>"The doctors are hopeful?"</p>

<p>"They have not lost hope."</p>

<p>"She seems to keep her strength wonderfully."</p>

<p>"Yes, wonderfully."</p>

<p>Mr. Lynde paused, looking downward, and awkwardly
turning his soft clerical hat in his large kind-looking
hands. "One might almost see in it a dispensation&mdash;<i>we</i>
should see one, Miss Brent."</p>

<p>"<i>We?</i>" She glanced up apologetically, not quite
sure that her tired mind had followed his meaning.</p>

<p>"We, I mean, who believe...that not one sparrow
falls to the ground...." He flushed, and went on in
a more mundane tone: "I am glad you have the hope
of Mr. Langhope's arrival to keep you up. Modern
science&mdash;thank heaven!&mdash;can do such wonders in sustaining
and prolonging life that, even if there is little
chance of recovery, the faint spark may be nursed
until...."</p>

<p>He paused again, conscious that the dusky-browed
young woman, slenderly erect in her dark blue linen
and nurse's cap, was examining him with an intentness
which contrasted curiously with the absent-minded
glance she had dropped on him in entering.</p>

<p>"In such cases," she said in a low tone, "there is
practically no chance of recovery."</p>

<p>"So I understand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[p 406]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even if there were, it would probably be death-in-life:
complete paralysis of the lower body."</p>

<p>He shuddered. "A dreadful fate! She was so gay
and active&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and the struggle with death, for the next few
weeks, must involve incessant suffering...frightful
suffering...perhaps vainly...."</p>

<p>"I feared so," he murmured, his kind face paling.</p>

<p>"Then why do you thank heaven that modern science
has found such wonderful ways of prolonging life?"</p>

<p>He raised his head with a start and their eyes met.
He saw that the nurse's face was pale and calm&mdash;almost
judicial in its composure&mdash;and his self-possession
returned to him.</p>

<p>"As a Christian," he answered, with his slow smile,
"I can hardly do otherwise."</p>

<p>Justine continued to consider him thoughtfully. "The
men of the older generation&mdash;clergymen, I mean," she
went on in a low controlled voice, "would of course
take that view&mdash;must take it. But the conditions are
so changed&mdash;so many undreamed-of means of prolonging
life&mdash;prolonging suffering&mdash;have been discovered
and applied in the last few years, that I wondered...in
my profession one often wonders...."</p>

<p>"I understand," he rejoined sympathetically, forgetting
his youth and his inexperience in the simple
desire to bring solace to a troubled mind. "I under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[p 407]</a></span>stand
your feeling&mdash;but you need have no doubt. Human
life is sacred, and the fact that, even in this materialistic
age, science is continually struggling to
preserve and prolong it, shows&mdash;very beautifully, I
think&mdash;how all things work together to fulfill the divine
will."</p>

<p>"Then you believe that the divine will delights in
mere pain&mdash;mere meaningless animal suffering&mdash;for its
own sake?"</p>

<p>"Surely not; but for the sake of the spiritual life
that may be mysteriously wrung out of it."</p>

<p>Justine bent her puzzled brows on him. "I could
understand that view of moral suffering&mdash;or even of
physical pain moderate enough to leave the mind clear,
and to call forth qualities of endurance and renunciation.
But where the body has been crushed to a pulp,
and the mind is no more than a machine for the registering
of sense-impressions of physical anguish, of
what use can such suffering be to its owner&mdash;or to the
divine will?"</p>

<p>The young rector looked at her sadly, almost severely.
"There, Miss Brent, we touch on inscrutable things,
and human reason must leave the answer to faith."</p>

<p>Justine pondered. "So that&mdash;one may say&mdash;Christianity
recognizes no exceptions&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;none," its authorized exponent pronounced
emphatically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[p 408]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Christianity and science are agreed." She
rose, and the young rector, with visible reluctance,
stood up also.</p>

<p>"That, again, is one of the most striking evidences&mdash;"
he began; and then, as the necessity of taking
leave was forced upon him, he added appealingly:
"I understand your uncertainties, your questionings,
and I wish I could have made my point clearer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you; it is quite clear. The reasons, of
course, are different; but the result is exactly the same."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, smiling sadly on him, and
with a sudden return of youth and self-consciousness,
he murmured shyly: "I feel for you"&mdash;the man in him
yearning over her loneliness, though the pastor dared not
press his help....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> evening, when Justine took her place at the
bedside, and the other two nurses had gone down
to supper, Bessy turned her head slightly, resting her
eyes on her friend.</p>

<p>The rose-shaded lamp cast a tint of life on her face,
and the dark circles of pain made her eyes look deeper
and brighter. Justine was almost deceived by the delusive
semblance of vitality, and a hope that was half
anguish stirred in her. She sat down by the bed, clasping
the hand on the sheet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[p 409]</a></span></p>

<p>"You feel better tonight?"</p>

<p>"I breathe...better...." The words came brokenly,
between long pauses, but without the hard
agonized gasps of the previous night.</p>

<p>"That's a good sign." Justine paused, and then,
letting her fingers glide once or twice over the back of
Bessy's hand&mdash;"You know, dear, Mr. Amherst is
coming," she leaned down to say.</p>

<p>Bessy's eyes moved again, slowly, inscrutably. She
had never asked for her husband.</p>

<p>"Soon?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"He had started on a long journey&mdash;to out-of-the-way
places&mdash;to study something about cotton growing&mdash;my
message has just overtaken him," Justine explained.</p>

<p>Bessy lay still, her breast straining for breath. She
remained so long without speaking that Justine began
to think she was falling back into the somnolent state
that intervened between her moments of complete consciousness.
But at length she lifted her lids again, and
her lips stirred.</p>

<p>"He will be...long...coming?"</p>

<p>"Some days."</p>

<p>"How...many?"</p>

<p>"We can't tell yet."</p>

<p>Silence again. Bessy's features seemed to shrink
into a kind of waxen quietude&mdash;as though her face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[p 410]</a></span>
were seen under clear water, a long way down. And
then, as she lay thus, without sound or movement, two
tears forced themselves through her lashes and rolled
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Justine, bending close, wiped them away. "Bessy&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wet lashes were raised&mdash;an anguished look met
her gaze.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't bear it...."</p>

<p>"What, dear?"</p>

<p>"The pain.... Shan't I die...before?"</p>

<p>"You may get well, Bessy."</p>

<p>Justine felt her hand quiver. "Walk again...?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps...not that."</p>

<p>"<i>This?</i> I can't bear it...." Her head drooped
sideways, turning away toward the wall.</p>

<p>Justine, that night, kept her vigil with an aching
heart. The news of Amherst's return had produced
no sign of happiness in his wife&mdash;- the tears had been
forced from her merely by the dread of being kept
alive during the long days of pain before he came.
The medical explanation might have been that repeated
crises of intense physical anguish, and the deep lassitude
succeeding them, had so overlaid all other feelings, or
at least so benumbed their expression, that it was impossible
to conjecture how Bessy's little half-smothered
spark of soul had really been affected by the news.
But Justine did not believe in this argument. Her ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[p 411]</a></span>perience
among the sick had convinced her, on the contrary,
that the shafts of grief or joy will find a crack in
the heaviest armour of physical pain, that the tiniest
gleam of hope will light up depths of mental inanition,
and somehow send a ray to the surface.... It was
true that Bessy had never known how to bear pain,
and that her own sensations had always formed the
centre of her universe&mdash;yet, for that very reason, if the
thought of seeing Amherst had made her happier it
would have lifted, at least momentarily, the weight of
death from her body.</p>

<p>Justine, at first, had almost feared the contrary effect&mdash;feared
that the moral depression might show itself
in a lowering of physical resistance. But the body
kept up its obstinate struggle against death, drawing
strength from sources of vitality unsuspected in that
frail envelope. The surgeon's report the next day was
more favourable, and every day won from death
pointed now to a faint chance of recovery.</p>

<p>Such at least was Wyant's view. Dr. Garford and
the consulting surgeons had not yet declared themselves;
but the young doctor, strung to the highest
point of watchfulness, and constantly in attendance on
the patient, was tending toward a hopeful prognosis.
The growing conviction spurred him to fresh efforts;
at Dr. Garford's request, he had temporarily handed
over his Clifton practice to a young New York doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[p 412]</a></span>
in need of change, and having installed himself at Lynbrook
he gave up his days and nights to Mrs. Amherst's
case.</p>

<p>"If any one can save her, Wyant will," Dr. Garford
had declared to Justine, when, on the tenth day after
the accident, the surgeons held their third consultation.
Dr. Garford reserved his own judgment. He had seen
cases&mdash;they had all seen cases...but just at present
the signs might point either way.... Meanwhile Wyant's
confidence was an invaluable asset toward the
patient's chances of recovery. Hopefulness in the physician
was almost as necessary as in the patient&mdash;contact
with such faith had been known to work
miracles.</p>

<p>Justine listened in silence, wishing that she too could
hope. But whichever way the prognosis pointed, she
felt only a dull despair. She believed no more than
Dr. Garford in the chance of recovery&mdash;that conviction
seemed to her a mirage of Wyant's imagination, of his
boyish ambition to achieve the impossible&mdash;and every
hopeful symptom pointed, in her mind, only to a longer
period of useless suffering.</p>

<p>Her hours at Bessy's side deepened her revolt against
the energy spent in the fight with death. Since Bessy
had learned that her husband was returning she had
never, by sign or word, reverted to the fact. Except
for a gleam of tenderness, now and then, when Cicely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[p 413]</a></span>
was brought to her, she seemed to have sunk back into
herself, as though her poor little flicker of consciousness
were wholly centred in the contemplation of its pain.
It was not that her mind was clouded&mdash;only that it was
immersed, absorbed, in that dread mystery of disproportionate
anguish which a capricious fate had laid on
it.... And what if she recovered, as they called it? If
the flood-tide of pain should ebb, leaving her stranded,
a helpless wreck on the desert shores of inactivity?
What would life be to Bessy without movement?
Thought would never set her blood flowing&mdash;motion, in
her, could only take the form of the physical processes.
Her love for Amherst was dead&mdash;even if it flickered
into life again, it could but put the spark to smouldering
discords and resentments; and would her one
uncontaminated sentiment&mdash;her affection for Cicely&mdash;suffice
to reconcile her to the desolate half-life which
was the utmost that science could hold out?</p>

<p>Here again, Justine's experience answered no. She
did not believe in Bessy's powers of moral recuperation&mdash;her
body seemed less near death than her spirit.
Life had been poured out to her in generous measure,
and she had spilled the precious draught&mdash;the few drops
remaining in the cup could no longer renew her strength.</p>

<p>Pity, not condemnation&mdash;profound illimitable pity&mdash;flowed
from this conclusion of Justine's. To a compassionate
heart there could be no sadder instance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[p 414]</a></span>
the wastefulness of life than this struggle of the small
half-formed soul with a destiny too heavy for its
strength. If Bessy had had any moral hope to fight
for, every pang of suffering would have been worth
enduring; but it was intolerable to witness the spectacle
of her useless pain.</p>

<p>Incessant commerce with such thoughts made Justine,
as the days passed, crave any escape from solitude,
any contact with other ideas. Even the reappearance
of Westy Gaines, bringing a breath of common-place
conventional grief into the haunted silence
of the house, was a respite from her questionings. If
it was hard to talk to him, to answer his enquiries, to
assent to his platitudes, it was harder, a thousand times,
to go on talking to herself....</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar's coming was a distinct relief. His
dryness was like cautery to her wound. Mr. Tredegar
undoubtedly grieved for Bessy; but his grief struck
inward, exuding only now and then, through the fissures
of his hard manner, in a touch of extra solemnity,
the more laboured rounding of a period. Yet, on the
whole, it was to his feeling that Justine felt her own to
be most akin. If his stoic acceptance of the inevitable
proceeded from the resolve to spare himself pain, that
at least was a form of strength, an indication of character.
She had never cared for the fluencies of invertebrate
sentiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[p 415]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, on the evening of the day after her talk with
Bessy, it was more than ever a solace to escape from
the torment of her thoughts into the rarefied air of Mr.
Tredegar's presence. The day had been a bad one
for the patient, and Justine's distress had been increased
by the receipt of a cable from Mr. Langhope,
announcing that, owing to delay in reaching Brindisi,
he had missed the fast steamer from Cherbourg, and
would not arrive till four or five days later than he had
expected. Mr. Tredegar, in response to her report,
had announced his intention of coming down by a late
train, and now he and Justine and Dr. Wyant, after
dining together, were seated before the fire in the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>"I take it, then," Mr. Tredegar said, turning to
Wyant, "that the chances of her living to see her father
are very slight."</p>

<p>The young doctor raised his head eagerly. "Not in
my opinion, sir. Unless unforeseen complications arise,
I can almost promise to keep her alive for another
month&mdash;I'm not afraid to call it six weeks!"</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;Garford doesn't say so."</p>

<p>"No; Dr. Garford argues from precedent."</p>

<p>"And you?" Mr. Tredegar's thin lips were visited
by the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't argue&mdash;I just feel my way," said Wyant
imperturbably.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[p 416]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet you don't hesitate to predict&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, sir; because the case, as I see it, presents
certain definite indications." He began to enumerate
them, cleverly avoiding the use of technicalities
and trying to make his point clear by the use of simple
illustration and analogy. It sickened Justine to listen
to his passionate exposition&mdash;she had heard it so often,
she believed in it so little.</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar turned a probing glance on him as he
ended. "Then, today even, you believe not only in the
possibility of prolonging life, but of ultimate recovery?"</p>

<p>Wyant hesitated. "I won't call it recovery&mdash;today.
Say&mdash;life indefinitely prolonged."</p>

<p>"And the paralysis?"</p>

<p>"It might disappear&mdash;after a few months&mdash;or a few
years."</p>

<p>"Such an outcome would be unusual?"</p>

<p>"Exceptional. But then there <i>are</i> exceptions. And
I'm straining every nerve to make this one!"</p>

<p>"And the suffering&mdash;such as today's, for instance&mdash;is
unavoidable?"</p>

<p>"Unhappily."</p>

<p>"And bound to increase?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as the an&aelig;sthetics lose their effect...."</p>

<p>There was a tap on the door, and one of the nurses
entered to report to Wyant. He went out with her, and
Justine was left with Mr. Tredegar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[p 417]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to her thoughtfully. "That young fellow
seems sure of himself. You believe in him?"</p>

<p>Justine hesitated. "Not in his expectation of recovery&mdash;no
one does."</p>

<p>"But you think they can keep the poor child alive
till Langhope and her husband get back?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause; then Justine murmured:
"It can be done...I think...."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it's horrible," said Mr. Tredegar suddenly,
as if in answer to her thought.</p>

<p>She looked up in surprise, and saw his eye resting
on her with what seemed like a mist of sympathy on
its vitreous surface. Her lips trembled, parting as if
for speech&mdash;but she looked away without answering.</p>

<p>"These new devices for keeping people alive," Mr.
Tredegar continued; "they increase the suffering besides
prolonging it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in some cases."</p>

<p>"In this case?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so."</p>

<p>The lawyer drew out his fine cambric handkerchief,
and furtively wiped a slight dampness from his forehead.
"I wish to God she had been killed!" he said.</p>

<p>Justine lifted her head again, with an answering exclamation.
"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"It's infernal&mdash;the time they can make it last."</p>

<p>"It's useless!" Justine broke out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[p 418]</a></span></p>

<p>"Useless?" He turned his critical glance on her.
"Well, that's beside the point&mdash;since it's inevitable."</p>

<p>She wavered a moment&mdash;but his words had loosened
the bonds about her heart, and she could not check
herself so suddenly. "Why inevitable?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar looked at her in surprise, as though
wondering at so unprofessional an utterance from one
who, under ordinary circumstances, showed the absolute
self-control and submission of the well-disciplined nurse.</p>

<p>"Human life is sacred," he said sententiously.</p>

<p>"Ah, that must have been decreed by some one who
had never suffered!" Justine exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Tredegar smiled compassionately: he evidently
knew how to make allowances for the fact that she was
overwrought by the sight of her friend's suffering:
"Society decreed it&mdash;not one person," he corrected.</p>

<p>"Society&mdash;science&mdash;religion!" she murmured, as if
to herself.</p>

<p>"Precisely. It's the universal consensus&mdash;the result
of the world's accumulated experience. Cruel in individual
instances&mdash;necessary for the general welfare.
Of course your training has taught you all this; but I
can understand that at such a time...."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, rising wearily as Wyant came in.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Her worst misery, now, was to have to discuss Bessy's
condition with Wyant. To the young physician Bessy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[p 419]</a></span>
was no longer a suffering, agonizing creature: she was
a case&mdash;a beautiful case. As the problem developed
new intricacies, becoming more and more of a challenge
to his faculties of observation and inference, Justine saw
the abstract scientific passion supersede his personal
feeling of pity. Though his professional skill made him
exquisitely tender to the patient under his hands, he
seemed hardly conscious that she was a woman who
had befriended him, and whom he had so lately seen
in the brightness of health and enjoyment. This view
was normal enough&mdash;it was, as Justine knew, the ideal
state of mind for the successful physician, in whom
sympathy for the patient as an individual must often
impede swift choice and unfaltering action. But what
she shrank from was his resolve to save Bessy's life&mdash;a
resolve fortified to the point of exasperation by the
scepticism of the consulting surgeons, who saw in it
only the youngster's natural desire to distinguish himself
by performing a feat which his elders deemed impossible.</p>

<p>As the days dragged on, and Bessy's sufferings increased,
Justine longed for a protesting word from
Dr. Garford or one of his colleagues. In her
hospital experience she had encountered cases where
the useless agonies of death were mercifully shortened
by the physician; why was not this a case for such
treatment? The answer was simple enough&mdash;in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[p 420]</a></span>
first place, it was the duty of the surgeons to keep
their patient alive till her husband and her father could
reach her; and secondly, there was that faint illusive
hope of so-called recovery, in which none of them believed,
yet which they could not ignore in their treatment.
The evening after Mr. Tredegar's departure
Wyant was setting this forth at great length to Justine.
Bessy had had a bad morning: the bronchial symptoms
which had developed a day or two before had
greatly increased her distress, and there had been, at
dawn, a moment of weakness when it seemed that
some pitiful power was about to defeat the relentless
efforts of science. But Wyant had fought off the peril.
By the prompt and audacious use of stimulants&mdash;by a
rapid marshalling of resources, a display of self-reliance
and authority, which Justine could not but admire as
she mechanically seconded his efforts&mdash;the spark of
life had been revived, and Bessy won back for fresh
suffering.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I say it can be done: tonight I say it more
than ever," Wyant exclaimed, pushing the disordered
hair from his forehead, and leaning toward Justine
across the table on which their brief evening meal had
been served. "I say the way the heart has rallied
proves that we've got more strength to draw on than
any of them have been willing to admit. The breathing's
better too. If we can fight off the degenerative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[p 421]</a></span>
processes&mdash;and, by George, I believe we can!" He
looked up suddenly at Justine. "With you to work
with, I believe I could do anything. How you do back
a man up! You think with your hands&mdash;with every
individual finger!"</p>

<p>Justine turned her eyes away: she felt a shudder of
repulsion steal over her tired body. It was not that
she detected any note of personal admiration in his
praise&mdash;he had commended her as the surgeon might
commend a fine instrument fashioned for his use.
But that she should be the instrument to serve such a
purpose&mdash;that her skill, her promptness, her gift of
divining and interpreting the will she worked with,
should be at the service of this implacable scientific
passion! Ah, no&mdash;she could be silent no longer....</p>

<p>She looked up at Wyant, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Why do you do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>He stared, as if thinking that she referred to some
special point in his treatment. "Do what?"</p>

<p>"It's so useless...you all know she must die."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the kind...and even the others
are not so sure today." He began to go over it all
again&mdash;repeating his arguments, developing new theories,
trying to force into her reluctant mind his own
faith in the possibility of success.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Justine sat resting her chin on her clasped hands, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[p 422]</a></span>
eyes gazing straight before her under dark tormented
brows. When he paused she remained silent.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;don't you believe me?" he broke out with
sudden asperity.</p>

<p>"I don't know...I can't tell...."</p>

<p>"But as long as there's a doubt, even&mdash;a doubt my
way&mdash;and I'll show you there is, if you'll give me
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much time?" she murmured, without shifting
her gaze.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;that depends on ourselves: on you and me
chiefly. That's what Garford admits. <i>They</i> can't do
much now&mdash;they've got to leave the game to us. It's
a question of incessant vigilance...of utilizing every
hour, every moment.... Time's all I ask, and <i>you</i>
can give it to me, if any one can!"</p>

<p>Under the challenge of his tone Justine rose to her
feet with a low murmur of fear. "Ah, don't ask me!"</p>

<p>"Don't ask you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't."</p>

<p>Wyant stood up also, turning on her an astonished
glance.</p>

<p>"You can't what&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and she thought she read in his a
sudden divination of her inmost thoughts. The discovery
electrified her flagging strength, restoring her
to immediate clearness of brain. She saw the gulf of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[p 423]</a></span>
self-betrayal over which she had hung, and the nearness
of the peril nerved her to a last effort of dissimulation.</p>

<p>"I can't...talk of it...any longer," she faltered,
letting her tears flow, and turning on him a face of
pure womanly weakness.</p>

<p>Wyant looked at her without answering. Did he
distrust even these plain physical evidences of exhaustion,
or was he merely disappointed in her, as in
one whom he had believed to be above the emotional
failings of her sex?</p>

<p>"You're over-tired," he said coldly. "Take tonight
to rest. Miss Mace can replace you for the next few
hours&mdash;and I may need you more tomorrow."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXIX" id="XXIX"></a>XXIX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> more days had passed. Bessy seldom spoke
when Justine was with her. She was wrapped in
a thickening cloud of opiates&mdash;morphia by day, bromides,
sulphonal, chloral hydrate at night. When the
cloud broke and consciousness emerged, it was centred
in the one acute point of bodily anguish. Darting
throes of neuralgia, agonized oppression of the breath,
the diffused misery of the whole helpless body&mdash;these
were reducing their victim to a mere instrument on
which pain played its incessant deadly variations. Once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[p 424]</a></span>
or twice she turned her dull eyes on Justine, breathing
out: "I want to die," as some inevitable lifting or readjusting
thrilled her body with fresh pangs; but there
were no signs of contact with the outer world&mdash;she had
ceased even to ask for Cicely....</p>

<p>And yet, according to the doctors, the patient held
her own. Certain alarming symptoms had diminished,
and while others persisted, the strength to fight them
persisted too. With such strength to call on, what
fresh agonies were reserved for the poor body when
the narcotics had lost their power?</p>

<p>That was the question always before Justine. She
never again betrayed her fears to Wyant&mdash;she carried
out his orders with morbid precision, trembling lest any
failure in efficiency should revive his suspicions. She
hardly knew what she feared his suspecting&mdash;she only
had a confused sense that they were enemies, and that
she was the weaker of the two.</p>

<p>And then the an&aelig;sthetics began to fail. It was the
sixteenth day since the accident, and the resources of
alleviation were almost exhausted. It was not sure,
even now, that Bessy was going to die&mdash;and she was
certainly going to suffer a long time. Wyant seemed
hardly conscious of the increase of pain&mdash;his whole
mind was fixed on the prognosis. What matter if the
patient suffered, as long as he proved his case? That,
of course, was not his way of putting it. In reality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[p 425]</a></span>
he did all he could to allay the pain, surpassed himself
in new devices and experiments. But death confronted
him implacably, claiming his due: so many hours robbed
from him, so much tribute to pay; and Wyant, setting
his teeth, fought on&mdash;and Bessy paid.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Justine had begun to notice that it was hard for her to
get a word alone with Dr. Garford. The other nurses
were not in the way&mdash;it was Wyant who always contrived
to be there. Perhaps she was unreasonable in
seeing a special intention in his presence: it was natural
enough that the two persons in charge of the case
should confer together with their chief. But his persistence
annoyed her, and she was glad when, one
afternoon, the surgeon asked him to telephone an important
message to town.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed, Justine said to Dr.
Garford: "She is beginning to suffer terribly."</p>

<p>He answered with the large impersonal gesture of the
man to whom physical suffering has become a painful
general fact of life, no longer divisible into individual
cases. "We are doing all we can."</p>

<p>"Yes." She paused, and then raised her eyes to his
dry kind face. "Is there any hope?"</p>

<p>Another gesture&mdash;the fatalistic sweep of the lifted
palms. "The next ten days will tell&mdash;the fight is on,
as Wyant says. And if any one can do it, that young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[p 426]</a></span>
fellow can. There's stuff in him&mdash;and infernal ambition."</p>

<p>"Yes: but do <i>you</i> believe she can live&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Dr. Garford smiled indulgently on such unprofessional
insistence; but she was past wondering what
they must all think of her.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Brent," he said, "I have reached the
age when one always leaves a door open to the unexpected."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a slight sound at her back made her
turn. Wyant was behind her&mdash;he must have entered
as she put her question. And he certainly could not
have had time to descend the stairs, walk the length
of the house, ring up New York, and deliver Dr
Garford's message.... The same thought seemed to
strike the surgeon. "Hello, Wyant?" he said.</p>

<p>"Line busy," said Wyant curtly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>About this time, Justine gave up her night vigils. She
could no longer face the struggle of the dawn hour,
when life ebbs lowest; and since her duties extended
beyond the sick-room she could fairly plead that she
was more needed about the house by day. But Wyant
protested: he wanted her most at the difficult hour.</p>

<p>"You know you're taking a chance from her," he
said, almost sternly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[p 427]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her searchingly. "You don't feel up to
it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He turned away with a slight shrug; but she knew he
resented her defection.</p>

<p>The day watches were miserable enough. It was the
nineteenth day now; and Justine lay on the sofa in
Amherst's sitting-room, trying to nerve herself for the
nurse's summons. A page torn out of the calendar lay
before her&mdash;she had been calculating again how many
days must elapse before Mr. Langhope could arrive.
Ten days&mdash;ten days and ten nights! And the length of
the nights was double.... As for Amherst, it was
impossible to set a date for his coming, for his steamer
from Buenos Ayres called at various ports on the way
northward, and the length of her stay at each was dependent
on the delivery of freight, and on the dilatoriness
of the South American official.</p>

<p>She threw down the calendar and leaned back,
pressing her hands to her temples. Oh, for a word
with Amherst&mdash;he alone would have understood what
she was undergoing! Mr. Langhope's coming would
make no difference&mdash;or rather, it would only increase
the difficulty of the situation. Instinctively Justine
felt that, though his heart would be wrung by the sight
of Bessy's pain, his cry would be the familiar one,
the traditional one: <i>Keep her alive!</i> Under his sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[p 428]</a></span>face
originality, his verbal audacities and ironies, Mr.
Langhope was the creature of accepted forms, inherited
opinions: he had never really thought for himself on
any of the pressing problems of life.</p>

<p>But Amherst was different. Close contact with many
forms of wretchedness had freed him from the bondage
of accepted opinion. He looked at life through no eyes
but his own; and what he saw, he confessed to seeing.
He never tried to evade the consequences of his discoveries.</p>

<p>Justine's remembrance flew back to their first meeting
at Hanaford, when his confidence in his own powers
was still unshaken, his trust in others unimpaired.
And, gradually, she began to relive each detail of their
talk at Dillon's bedside&mdash;her first impression of him,
as he walked down the ward; the first sound of his
voice; her surprised sense of his authority; her almost
involuntary submission to his will.... Then her
thoughts passed on to their walk home from the hospital&mdash;she
recalled his sober yet unsparing summary of
the situation at Westmore, and the note of insight with
which he touched on the hardships of the workers....
Then, word by word, their talk about Dillon came
back...Amherst's indignation and pity...his shudder
of revolt at the man's doom.</p>

<p>"<i>In your work, don't you ever feel tempted to set a
poor devil free?</i>" And then, after her conventional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[p 429]</a></span>
murmur of protest: "<i>To save what, when all the good
of life is gone?</i>"</p>

<p>To distract her thoughts she stretched her hand
toward the book-case, taking out the first volume in
reach&mdash;the little copy of Bacon. She leaned back,
fluttering its pages aimlessly&mdash;so wrapped in her own
misery that the meaning of the words could not reach
her. It was useless to try to read: every perception of
the outer world was lost in the hum of inner activity
that made her mind like a forge throbbing with heat and
noise. But suddenly her glance fell on some pencilled
sentences on the fly-leaf. They were in Amherst's hand,
and the sight arrested her as though she had heard
him speak.</p>

<p><i>La vraie morale se moque de la morale....</i></p>

<p><i>We perish because we follow other men's examples....</i></p>

<p><i>Socrates used to call the opinions of the many by the
name of Lami&aelig;&mdash;bugbears to frighten children....</i></p>

<p>A rush of air seemed to have been let into her stifled
mind. Were they his own thoughts? No&mdash;her memory
recalled some confused association with great names.
But at least they must represent his beliefs&mdash;must embody
deeply-felt convictions&mdash;or he would scarcely have
taken the trouble to record them.</p>

<p>She murmured over the last sentence once or twice:
<i>The opinions of the many&mdash;bugbears to frighten children....</i>
Yes, she had often heard him speak of cur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[p 430]</a></span>rent
judgments in that way...she had never known
a mind so free from the spell of the Lami&aelig;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some one knocked, and she put aside the book and
rose to her feet. It was a maid bringing a note from
Wyant.</p>

<p>"There has been a motor accident beyond Clifton,
and I have been sent for. I think I can safely be away
for two or three hours, but ring me up at Clifton if you
want me. Miss Mace has instructions, and Garford's
assistant will be down at seven."</p>

<p>She looked at the clock: it was just three, the hour
at which she was to relieve Miss Mace. She smoothed
the hair from her forehead, straightened her cap, tied
on the apron she had laid aside....</p>

<p>As she entered Bessy's sitting-room the nurse came
out, memoranda in hand. The two moved to the window
for a moment's conference, and as the wintry light
fell on Miss Mace's face, Justine saw that it was white
with fatigue.</p>

<p>"You're ill!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The nurse shook her head. "No&mdash;but it's awful...this
afternoon...." Her glance turned to the sick-room.</p>

<p>"Go and rest&mdash;I'll stay till bedtime," Justine said.</p>

<p>"Miss Safford's down with another headache."</p>

<p>"I know: it doesn't matter. I'm quite fresh."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[p 431]</a></span></p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> look rested!" the other exclaimed, her eyes
lingering enviously on Justine's face.</p>

<p>She stole away, and Justine entered the room. It
was true that she felt fresh&mdash;a new spring of hope
had welled up in her. She had her nerves in hand
again, she had regained her steady vision of life....</p>

<p>But in the room, as the nurse had said, it was awful.
The time had come when the effect of the an&aelig;sthetics
must be carefully husbanded, when long intervals of
pain must purchase the diminishing moments of relief.
Yet from Wyant's standpoint it was a good day&mdash;things
were looking well, as he would have phrased it. And
each day now was a fresh victory.</p>

<p>Justine went through her task mechanically. The
glow of strength and courage remained, steeling her to
bear what had broken down Miss Mace's professional
fortitude. But when she sat down by the bed Bessy's
moaning began to wear on her. It was no longer the
utterance of human pain, but the monotonous whimper
of an animal&mdash;the kind of sound that a compassionate
hand would instinctively crush into silence. But her
hand had other duties; she must keep watch on pulse
and heart, must reinforce their action with the tremendous
stimulants which Wyant was now using, and,
having revived fresh sensibility to pain, must presently
try to allay it by the cautious use of narcotics.</p>

<p>It was all simple enough&mdash;but suppose she should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[p 432]</a></span>
not do it? Suppose she left the stimulants untouched?
Wyant was absent, one nurse exhausted with
fatigue, the other laid low by headache. Justine had
the field to herself. For three hours at least no one
was likely to cross the threshold of the sick-room....
Ah, if no more time were needed! But there was too
much life in Bessy&mdash;her youth was fighting too hard
for her! She would not sink out of life in three hours...and
Justine could not count on more than that.</p>

<p>She looked at the little travelling-clock on the dressing-table,
and saw that its hands marked four. An
hour had passed already.... She rose and administered
the prescribed restorative; then she took the pulse,
and listened to the beat of the heart. Strong still&mdash;too
strong!</p>

<p>As she lifted her head, the vague animal wailing
ceased, and she heard her name: "Justine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She bent down eagerly. "Yes?"</p>

<p>No answer: the wailing had begun again. But the
one word showed her that the mind still lived in its
torture-house, that the poor powerless body before her
was not yet a mere bundle of senseless reflexes, but her
friend Bessy Amherst, dying, and feeling herself die....</p>

<p>Justine reseated herself, and the vigil began again.
The second hour ebbed slowly&mdash;ah, no, it was flying
now! Her eyes were on the hands of the clock and
they seemed leagued against her to devour the precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[p 433]</a></span>
minutes. And now she could see by certain spasmodic
symptoms that another crisis of pain was approaching&mdash;one
of the struggles that Wyant, at times, had almost
seemed to court and exult in.</p>

<p>Bessy's eyes turned on her again. "<i>Justine</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She knew what that meant: it was an appeal for the
hypodermic needle. The little instrument lay at hand,
beside a newly-filled bottle of morphia. But she must
wait&mdash;must let the pain grow more severe. Yet she
could not turn her gaze from Bessy, and Bessy's eyes
entreated her again&mdash;<i>Justine</i>! There was really no
word now&mdash;the whimperings were uninterrupted. But
Justine heard an inner voice, and its pleading shook her
heart. She rose and filled the syringe&mdash;and returning
with it, bent above the bed....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>She lifted her head and looked at the clock. The second
hour had passed. As she looked, she heard a step
in the sitting-room. Who could it be? Not Dr. Garford's
assistant&mdash;he was not due till seven. She listened
again.... One of the nurses? No, not a
woman's step&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The door opened, and Wyant came in. Justine
stood by the bed without moving toward him. He
paused also, as if surprised to see her there motionless.
In the intense silence she fancied for a moment that
she heard Bessy's violent agonized breathing. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[p 434]</a></span>
tried to speak, to drown the sound of the breathing;
but her lips trembled too much, and she remained
silent.</p>

<p>Wyant seemed to hear nothing. He stood so still
that she felt she must move forward. As she did so,
she picked up from the table by the bed the memoranda
that it was her duty to submit to him.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, in the familiar sick-room whisper.</p>

<p>"She is dead."</p>

<p>He fell back a step, glaring at her, white and incredulous.</p>

<p>"<i>Dead?</i>&mdash;When&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago...."</p>

<p>"<i>Dead&mdash;?</i> It's not possible!"</p>

<p>He swept past her, shouldering her aside, pushing in
an electric button as he sprang to the bed. She perceived
then that the room had been almost in darkness.
She recovered command of herself, and followed him.
He was going through the usual rapid examination&mdash;pulse,
heart, breath&mdash;hanging over the bed like some
angry animal balked of its prey. Then he lifted the
lids and bent close above the eyes.</p>

<p>"Take the shade off that lamp!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Justine obeyed him.</p>

<p>He stooped down again to examine the eyes...he
remained stooping a long time. Suddenly he stood up
and faced her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[p 435]</a></span></p>

<p>"Had she been in great pain?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Worse than usual?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What had you done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;there was no time."</p>

<p>"No time?" He broke off to sweep the room again
with his excited incredulous glance. "Where are the
others? Why were you here alone?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It came suddenly. I was going to call&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their eyes met for a moment. Her face was perfectly
calm&mdash;she could feel that her lips no longer trembled.
She was not in the least afraid of Wyant's
scrutiny.</p>

<p>As he continued to look at her, his expression slowly
passed from incredulous wrath to something softer&mdash;more
human&mdash;she could not tell what....</p>

<p>"This has been too much for you&mdash;go and send one of
the others.... It's all over," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[p 436]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a September day, somewhat more than a year
and a half after Bessy Amherst's death, her
husband and his mother sat at luncheon in the dining-room
of the Westmore house at Hanaford.</p>

<p>The house was John Amherst's now, and shortly
after the loss of his wife he had established himself
there with his mother. By a will made some six
months before her death, Bessy had divided her
estate between her husband and daughter, placing
Cicely's share in trust, and appointing Mr. Langhope
and Amherst as her guardians. As the latter was also
her trustee, the whole management of the estate devolved
on him, while his control of the Westmore mills
was ensured by his receiving a slightly larger proportion
of the stock than his step-daughter.</p>

<p>The will had come as a surprise, not only to
Amherst himself, but to his wife's family, and more
especially to her legal adviser. Mr. Tredegar had in
fact had nothing to do with the drawing of the instrument;
but as it had been drawn in due form, and by a
firm of excellent standing, he was obliged, in spite of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[p 437]</a></span>
private views, and Mr. Langhope's open adjurations
that he should "do something," to declare that there
was no pretext for questioning the validity of the
document.</p>

<p>To Amherst the will was something more than a
proof of his wife's confidence: it came as a reconciling
word from her grave. For the date showed that it had
been made at a moment when he supposed himself to
have lost all influence over her&mdash;on the morrow of the
day when she had stipulated that he should give up
the management of the Westmore mills, and yield the
care of her property to Mr. Tredegar.</p>

<p>While she smote him with one hand, she sued for
pardon with the other; and the contradiction was so
characteristic, it explained and excused in so touching
a way the inconsistencies of her impulsive heart and
hesitating mind, that he was filled with that tender
compunction, that searching sense of his own shortcomings,
which generous natures feel when they find
they have underrated the generosity of others. But
Amherst's was not an introspective mind, and his
sound moral sense told him, when the first pang of
self-reproach had subsided, that he had done his best
by his wife, and was in no way to blame if her recognition
of the fact had come too late. The self-reproach
subsided; and, instead of the bitterness of the past, it
left a softened memory which made him take up his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[p 438]</a></span>
task with the sense that he was now working with Bessy
and not against her.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps, after all, it was chiefly the work itself
which had healed old wounds, and quelled the tendency
to vain regrets. Amherst was only thirty-four;
and in the prime of his energies the task he was made
for had been given back to him. To a sound nature,
which finds its outlet in fruitful action, nothing so simplifies
the complexities of life, so tends to a large acceptance
of its vicissitudes and mysteries, as the sense
of doing something each day toward clearing one's own
bit of the wilderness. And this was the joy at last conceded
to Amherst. The mills were virtually his; and
the fact that he ruled them not only in his own right but
as Cicely's representative, made him doubly eager to
justify his wife's trust in him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst, looking up from a telegram which the
parlour-maid had handed her, smiled across the table
at her son.</p>

<p>"From Maria Ansell&mdash;they are all coming tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;that's good," Amherst rejoined. "I should
have been sorry if Cicely had not been here."</p>

<p>"Mr. Langhope is coming too," his mother continued.
"I'm glad of that, John."</p>

<p>"Yes," Amherst again assented.</p>

<p>The morrow was to be a great day at Westmore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[p 439]</a></span>
The Emergency Hospital, planned in the first months
of his marriage, and abandoned in the general reduction
of expenditure at the mills, had now been completed
on a larger and more elaborate scale, as a memorial
to Bessy. The strict retrenchment of all personal
expenses, and the leasing of Lynbrook and the
town house, had enabled Amherst, in eighteen months,
to lay by enough income to carry out this plan, which
he was impatient to see executed as a visible commemoration
of his wife's generosity to Westmore. For
Amherst persisted in regarding the gift of her fortune
as a gift not to himself but to the mills: he looked on
himself merely as the agent of her beneficent intentions.
He was anxious that Westmore and Hanaford
should take the same view; and the opening of the
Westmore Memorial Hospital was therefore to be performed
with an unwonted degree of ceremony.</p>

<p>"I am glad Mr. Langhope is coming," Mrs. Amherst
repeated, as they rose from the table. "It shows,
dear&mdash;doesn't it?&mdash;that he's really gratified&mdash;that he
appreciates your motive...."</p>

<p>She raised a proud glance to her tall son, whose head
seemed to tower higher than ever above her small proportions.
Renewed self-confidence, and the habit of
command, had in fact restored the erectness to Amherst's
shoulders and the clearness to his eyes. The
cleft between the brows was gone, and his veiled in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[p 440]</a></span>ward
gaze had given place to a glance almost as outward-looking
and unspeculative as his mother's.</p>

<p>"It shows&mdash;well, yes&mdash;what you say!" he rejoined
with a slight laugh, and a tap on her shoulder as she
passed.</p>

<p>He was under no illusions as to his father-in-law's
attitude: he knew that Mr. Langhope would willingly
have broken the will which deprived his grand-daughter
of half her inheritance, and that his subsequent show
of friendliness was merely a concession to expediency.
But in his present mood Amherst almost believed that
time and closer relations might turn such sentiments
into honest liking. He was very fond of his little step-daughter,
and deeply sensible of his obligations toward
her; and he hoped that, as Mr. Langhope came to
recognize this, it might bring about a better understanding
between them.</p>

<p>His mother detained him. "You're going back to
the mills at once? I wanted to consult you about the
rooms. Miss Brent had better be next to Cicely?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;yes. I'll see you before I go." He
nodded affectionately and passed on, his hands full of
papers, into the Oriental smoking-room, now dedicated
to the unexpected uses of an office and study.</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst, as she turned away, found the parlour-maid
in the act of opening the front door to the highly-tinted
and well-dressed figure of Mrs. Harry Dressel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[p 441]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so delighted to hear that you're expecting Justine,"
began Mrs. Dressel as the two ladies passed into
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Ah, you've heard too?" Mrs. Amherst rejoined,
enthroning her visitor in one of the monumental plush
armchairs beneath the threatening weight of the Bay
of Naples.</p>

<p>"I hadn't till this moment; in fact I flew in to ask
for news, and on the door-step there was such a striking-looking
young man enquiring for her, and I heard the
parlour-maid say she was arriving tomorrow."</p>

<p>"A young man? Some one you didn't know?"
Striking apparitions of the male sex were of infrequent
occurrence at Hanaford, and Mrs. Amherst's unabated
interest in the movement of life caused her to dwell on
this statement.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;I'm sure he was a stranger. Extremely
slight and pale, with remarkable eyes. He was so
disappointed&mdash;he seemed sure of finding her."</p>

<p>"Well, no doubt he'll come back tomorrow.&mdash;You
know we're expecting the whole party," added Mrs.
Amherst, to whom the imparting of good news was
always an irresistible temptation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel's interest deepened at once. "Really?
Mr. Langhope too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a great pleasure to my son."</p>

<p>"It must be! I'm so glad. I suppose in a way it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[p 442]</a></span>
will be rather sad for Mr. Langhope&mdash;seeing everything
here so unchanged&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst straightened herself a little. "I think
he will prefer to find it so," she said, with a barely
perceptible change of tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. They were never very fond of
this house."</p>

<p>There was an added note of authority in Mrs.
Dressel's accent. In the last few months she had been
to Europe and had had nervous prostration, and these
incontestable evidences of growing prosperity could not
always be kept out of her voice and bearing. At any
rate, they justified her in thinking that her opinion on
almost any subject within the range of human experience
was a valuable addition to the sum-total of wisdom;
and unabashed by the silence with which her
comment was received, she continued her critical survey
of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Amherst&mdash;you know I can't help
saying what I think&mdash;and I've so often wondered
why you don't do this room over. With these
high ceilings you could do something lovely in Louis
Seize."</p>

<p>A faint pink rose to Mrs. Amherst's cheeks. "I
don't think my son would ever care to make any
changes here," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand his feeling; but when he begins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[p 443]</a></span>
to entertain&mdash;and you know poor Bessy always <i>hated</i>
this furniture."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst smiled slightly. "Perhaps if he marries
again&mdash;" she said, seizing at random on a pretext
for changing the subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel dropped the hands with which she was
absent-mindedly assuring herself of the continuance of
unbroken relations between her hat and her hair.</p>

<p>"<i>Marries again?</i> Why&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;? He
doesn't think of it?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least&mdash;I spoke figuratively," her hostess
rejoined with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course&mdash;I see. He really <i>couldn't</i> marry,
could he? I mean, it would be so wrong to Cicely&mdash;under
the circumstances."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst's black eye-brows gathered in a slight
frown. She had already noticed, on the part of the
Hanaford clan, a disposition to regard Amherst as
imprisoned in the conditions of his trust, and committed
to the obligation of handing on unimpaired to
Cicely the fortune his wife's caprice had bestowed on
him; and this open expression of the family view was
singularly displeasing to her.</p>

<p>"I had not thought of it in that light&mdash;but it's really
of no consequence how one looks at a thing that is not
going to happen," she said carelessly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;naturally; I see you were only joking. He's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[p 444]</a></span>
so devoted to Cicely, isn't he?" Mrs. Dressel rejoined,
with her bright obtuseness.</p>

<p>A step on the threshold announced Amherst's approach.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I must be off, mother&mdash;" he began, halting
in the doorway with the instinctive masculine recoil
from the afternoon caller.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Amherst, how d'you do? I suppose you're
very busy about tomorrow? I just flew in to find out
if Justine was really coming," Mrs. Dressel explained,
a little fluttered by the effort of recalling what she had
been saying when he entered.</p>

<p>"I believe my mother expects the whole party," Amherst
replied, shaking hands with the false <i>bonhomie</i> of
the man entrapped.</p>

<p>"How delightful! And it's so nice to think that Mr.
Langhope's arrangement with Justine still works so
well," Mrs. Dressel hastened on, nervously hoping that
her volubility would smother any recollection of what
he had chanced to overhear.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langhope is lucky in having persuaded Miss
Brent to take charge of Cicely," Mrs. Amherst quietly
interposed.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and it was so lucky for Justine too! When
she came back from Europe with us last autumn, I
could see she simply hated the idea of taking up her
nursing again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[p 445]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst's face darkened at the allusion, and his
mother said hurriedly: "Ah, she was tired, poor child;
but I'm only afraid that, after the summer's rest, she
may want some more active occupation than looking
after a little girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think not&mdash;she's so fond of Cicely. And of
course it's everything to her to have a comfortable
home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amherst smiled. "At her age, it's not always
everything."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dressel stared slightly. "Oh, Justine's twenty-seven,
you know; she's not likely to marry now," she
said, with the mild finality of the early-wedded.</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, extending cordial hands of
farewell. "You must be so busy preparing for the
great day...if only it doesn't rain!... No, <i>please</i>,
Mr. Amherst!... It's a mere step&mdash;I'm walking...."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That afternoon, as Amherst walked out toward Westmore
for a survey of the final preparations, he found
that, among the pleasant thoughts accompanying him,
one of the pleasantest was the anticipation of seeing
Justine Brent.</p>

<p>Among the little group who were to surround him on
the morrow, she was the only one discerning enough to
understand what the day meant to him, or with sufficient
knowledge to judge of the use he had made of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[p 446]</a></span>
his great opportunity. Even now that the opportunity
had come, and all obstacles were levelled, sympathy
with his work was as much lacking as ever; and only
Duplain, at length reinstated as manager, really understood
and shared in his aims. But Justine Brent's
sympathy was of a different kind from the manager's.
If less logical, it was warmer, more penetrating&mdash;like
some fine imponderable fluid, so subtle that it could
always find a way through the clumsy processes of
human intercourse. Amherst had thought very often
of this quality in her during the weeks which followed
his abrupt departure for Georgia; and in trying
to define it he had said to himself that she felt with her
brain.</p>

<p>And now, aside from the instinctive understanding
between them, she was set apart in his thoughts by her
association with his wife's last days. On his arrival
from the south he had gathered on all sides evidences
of her tender devotion to Bessy: even Mr. Tredegar's
chary praise swelled the general commendation. From
the surgeons he heard how her unwearied skill had
helped them in their fruitless efforts; poor Cicely,
awed by her loss, clung to her mother's friend with
childish tenacity; and the young rector of Saint Anne's,
shyly acquitting himself of his visit of condolence,
dwelt chiefly on the consolatory thought of Miss
Brent's presence at the death-bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[p 447]</a></span></p>

<p>The knowledge that Justine had been with his wife
till the end had, in fact, done more than anything else
to soften Amherst's regrets; and he had tried to express
something of this in the course of his first talk
with her. Justine had given him a clear and self-possessed
report of the dreadful weeks at Lynbrook;
but at his first allusion to her own part in them, she
shrank into a state of distress which seemed to plead
with him to refrain from even the tenderest touch on
her feelings. It was a peculiarity of their friendship
that silence and absence had always mysteriously fostered
its growth; and he now felt that her reticence
deepened the understanding between them as the freest
confidences might not have done.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, an opportune attack of nervous prostration
had sent Mrs. Harry Dressel abroad; and Justine
was selected as her companion. They remained
in Europe for six months; and on their return Amherst
learned with pleasure that Mr. Langhope had asked
Miss Brent to take charge of Cicely.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's sorrow for his daughter had been
aggravated by futile wrath at her unaccountable will;
and the mixed sentiment thus engendered had found
expression in a jealous outpouring of affection toward
Cicely. He took immediate possession of the child,
and in the first stages of his affliction her companionship
had been really consoling. But as time passed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[p 448]</a></span>
and the pleasant habits of years reasserted themselves,
her presence became, in small unacknowledged
ways, a source of domestic irritation. Nursery hours
disturbed the easy routine of his household; the elderly
parlour-maid who had long ruled it resented the intervention
of Cicely's nurse; the little governess, involved
in the dispute, broke down and had to be shipped home
to Germany; a successor was hard to find, and in the
interval Mr. Langhope's privacy was invaded by a
stream of visiting teachers, who were always wanting
to consult him about Cicely's lessons, and lay before
him their tiresome complaints and perplexities. Poor
Mr. Langhope found himself in the position of the
mourner who, in the first fervour of bereavement, has
undertaken the construction of an imposing monument
without having counted the cost. He had meant that
his devotion to Cicely should be a monument to his
paternal grief; but the foundations were scarcely laid
when he found that the funds of time and patience
were almost exhausted.</p>

<p>Pride forbade his consigning Cicely to her step-father,
though Mrs. Amherst would gladly have undertaken
her care; Mrs. Ansell's migratory habits made it
impossible for her to do more than intermittently hover
and advise; and a new hope rose before Mr. Langhope
when it occurred to him to appeal to Miss Brent.</p>

<p>The experiment had proved a success, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[p 449]</a></span>
Amherst met Justine again she had been for some
months in charge of the little girl, and change and congenial
occupation had restored her to a normal view
of life. There was no trace in her now of the dumb
misery which had haunted him at their parting; she
was again the vivid creature who seemed more charged
with life than any one he had ever known. The crisis
through which she had passed showed itself only in a
smoothing of the brow and deepening of the eyes, as
though a bloom of experience had veiled without deadening
the first brilliancy of youth.</p>

<p>As he lingered on the image thus evoked, he recalled
Mrs. Dressel's words: "Justine is twenty-seven&mdash;she's
not likely to marry now."</p>

<p>Oddly enough, he had never thought of her marrying&mdash;but
now that he heard the possibility questioned,
he felt a disagreeable conviction of its inevitableness.
Mrs. Dressel's view was of course absurd. In spite of
Justine's feminine graces, he had formerly felt in her a
kind of elfin immaturity, as of a flitting Ariel with untouched
heart and senses: it was only of late that she
had developed the subtle quality which calls up thoughts
of love. Not marry? Why, the vagrant fire had just
lighted on her&mdash;and the fact that she was poor and unattached,
with her own way to make, and no setting
of pleasure and elegance to embellish her&mdash;these disadvantages
seemed as nothing to Amherst against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[p 450]</a></span>
warmth of personality in which she moved. And besides,
she would never be drawn to the kind of man
who needed fine clothes and luxury to point him to
the charm of sex. She was always finished and graceful
in appearance, with the pretty woman's art of wearing
her few plain dresses as if they were many and
varied; yet no one could think of her as attaching much
importance to the upholstery of life.... No, the man
who won her would be of a different type, have other
inducements to offer...and Amherst found himself
wondering just what those inducements would be.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered something his mother had
said as he left the house&mdash;something about a distinguished-looking
young man who had called to ask
for Miss Brent. Mrs. Amherst, innocently inquisitive
in small matters, had followed her son into the hall to
ask the parlour-maid if the gentleman had left his
name; and the parlour-maid had answered in the negative.
The young man was evidently not indigenous:
all the social units of Hanaford were intimately known
to each other. He was a stranger, therefore, presumably
drawn there by the hope of seeing Miss Brent.
But if he knew that she was coming he must be intimately
acquainted with her movements.... The
thought came to Amherst as an unpleasant surprise.
It showed him for the first time how little he knew of
Justine's personal life, of the ties she might have formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[p 451]</a></span>
outside the Lynbrook circle. After all, he had seen
her chiefly not among her own friends but among his
wife's. Was it reasonable to suppose that a creature
of her keen individuality would be content to subsist
on the fringe of other existences? Somewhere, of
course, she must have a centre of her own, must be
subject to influences of which he was wholly ignorant.
And since her departure from Lynbrook he had known
even less of her life. She had spent the previous winter
with Mr. Langhope in New York, where Amherst
had seen her only on his rare visits to Cicely; and Mr.
Langhope, on going abroad for the summer, had established
his grand-daughter in a Bar Harbour cottage,
where, save for two flying visits from Mrs.
Ansell, Miss Brent had reigned alone till his return in
September.</p>

<p>Very likely, Amherst reflected, the mysterious visitor
was a Bar Harbour acquaintance&mdash;no, more than an
acquaintance: a friend. And as Mr. Langhope's party
had left Mount Desert but three days previously, the
arrival of the unknown at Hanaford showed a singular
impatience to rejoin Miss Brent.</p>

<p>As he reached this point in his meditations, Amherst
found himself at the street-corner where it was his
habit to pick up the Westmore trolley. Just as it bore
down on him, and he sprang to the platform, another
car, coming in from the mills, stopped to discharge its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[p 452]</a></span>
passengers. Among them Amherst noticed a slender
undersized man in shabby clothes, about whose retreating
back, as he crossed the street to signal a Station
Avenue car, there was something dimly familiar, and
suggestive of troubled memories. Amherst leaned out
and looked again: yes, the back was certainly like Dr.
Wyant's&mdash;but what could Wyant be doing at Hanaford,
and in a Westmore car?</p>

<p>Amherst's first impulse was to spring out and overtake
him. He knew how admirably the young physician
had borne himself at Lynbrook; he even recalled
Dr. Garford's saying, with his kindly sceptical
smile: "Poor Wyant believed to the end that we could
save her"&mdash;and felt again his own inward movement of
thankfulness that the cruel miracle had not been worked.</p>

<p>He owed a great deal to Wyant, and had tried to
express his sense of the fact by warm words and a
liberal fee; but since Bessy's death he had never returned
to Lynbrook, and had consequently lost sight
of the young doctor.</p>

<p>Now he felt that he ought to try to rejoin him, to
find out why he was at Hanaford, and make some
proffer of hospitality; but if the stranger were really
Wyant, his choice of the Station Avenue car made it
appear that he was on his way to catch the New
York express; and in any case Amherst's engagements
at Westmore made immediate pursuit impossible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[p 453]</a></span></p>

<p>He consoled himself with the thought that if the physician
was not leaving Hanaford he would be certain
to call at the house; and then his mind flew back to
Justine Brent. But the pleasure of looking forward
to her arrival was disturbed by new feelings. A sense
of reserve and embarrassment had sprung up in his
mind, checking that free mental communion which, as
he now perceived, had been one of the unconscious
promoters of their friendship. It was as though his
thoughts faced a stranger instead of the familiar presence
which had so long dwelt in them; and he began
to see that the feeling of intelligence existing between
Justine and himself was not the result of actual intimacy,
but merely of the charm she knew how to throw
over casual intercourse.</p>

<p>When he had left his house, his mind was like a summer
sky, all open blue and sunlit rolling clouds; but
gradually the clouds had darkened and massed themselves,
till they drew an impenetrable veil over the
upper light and stretched threateningly across his
whole horizon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXXI" id="XXXI"></a>XXXI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> celebrations at Westmore were over. Hanaford
society, mustering for the event, had streamed
through the hospital, inspected the clinic, complimented
Amherst, recalled itself to Mr. Langhope and Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[p 454]</a></span>
Ansell, and streamed out again to regain its carriages
and motors.</p>

<p>The chief actors in the ceremony were also taking
leave. Mr. Langhope, somewhat pale and nervous
after the ordeal, had been helped into the Gaines
landau with Mrs. Ansell and Cicely; Mrs. Amherst
had accepted a seat in the Dressel victoria; and
Westy Gaines, with an <i>empressement</i> slightly tinged by
condescension, was in the act of placing his electric
phaeton at Miss Brent's disposal.</p>

<p>She stood in the pretty white porch of the hospital,
looking out across its squares of flower-edged turf at
the long street of Westmore. In the warm gold-powdered
light of September the factory town still
seemed a blot on the face of nature; yet here and
there, on all sides, Justine's eye saw signs of humanizing
change. The rough banks along the street had
been levelled and sodded; young maples, set in rows,
already made a long festoon of gold against the dingy
house-fronts; and the houses themselves&mdash;once so
irreclaimably outlawed and degraded&mdash;showed, in their
white-curtained windows, their flowery white-railed
yards, a growing approach to civilized human dwellings.</p>

<p>Glancing the other way, one still met the grim pile
of factories cutting the sky with their harsh roof-lines
and blackened chimneys; but here also were signs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[p 455]</a></span>
improvement. One of the mills had already been enlarged,
another was scaffolded for the same purpose,
and young trees and neatly-fenced turf replaced the
surrounding desert of trampled earth.</p>

<p>As Amherst came out of the hospital, he heard Miss
Brent declining a seat in Westy's phaeton.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much; but there's some one here I
want to see first&mdash;one of the operatives&mdash;and I can
easily take a Hanaford car." She held out her hand
with the smile that ran like colour over her whole face;
and Westy, nettled by this unaccountable disregard of
her privileges, mounted his chariot alone.</p>

<p>As he glided mournfully away, Amherst turned to
Justine. "You wanted to see the Dillons?" he asked.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and she smiled again. He had never
seen her so sunned-over, so luminous, since the distant
November day when they had picnicked with Cicely
beside the swamp. He wondered vaguely if she were
more elaborately dressed than usual, or if the festal
impression she produced were simply a reflection of
her mood.</p>

<p>"I do want to see the Dillons&mdash;how did you
guess?" she rejoined; and Amherst felt a sudden impulse
to reply: "For the same reason that made you
think of them."</p>

<p>The fact of her remembering the Dillons made
him absurdly happy; it re-established between them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[p 456]</a></span>
the mental communion that had been checked by his
thoughts of the previous day.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm rather self-conscious about the Dillons,
because they're one of my object lessons&mdash;they illustrate
the text," he said laughing, as they went down the steps.</p>

<p>Westmore had been given a half-holiday for the
opening of the hospital, and as Amherst and Justine
turned into the street, parties of workers were dispersing
toward their houses. They were still a dull-eyed
stunted throng, to whom air and movement seemed
to have been too long denied; but there was more animation
in the groups, more light in individual faces;
many of the younger men returned Amherst's good-day
with a look of friendliness, and the women to whom he
spoke met him with a volubility that showed the habit
of frequent intercourse.</p>

<p>"How much you have done!" Justine exclaimed, as
he rejoined her after one of these asides; but the next
moment he saw a shade of embarrassment cross her
face, as though she feared to have suggested comparisons
she had meant to avoid.</p>

<p>He answered quite naturally: "Yes&mdash;I'm beginning
to see my way now; and it's wonderful how they respond&mdash;"
and they walked on without a shadow of
constraint between them, while he described to her
what was already done, and what direction his projected
experiments were taking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[p 457]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dillons had been placed in charge of one of the
old factory tenements, now transformed into a lodging-house
for unmarried operatives. Even its harsh brick
exterior, hung with creepers and brightened by flower-borders,
had taken on a friendly air; and indoors it had
a clean sunny kitchen, a big dining-room with cheerful-coloured
walls, and a room where the men could lounge
and smoke about a table covered with papers.</p>

<p>The creation of these model lodging-houses had
always been a favourite scheme of Amherst's, and the
Dillons, incapacitated for factory work, had shown
themselves admirably adapted to their new duties. In
Mrs. Dillon's small hot sitting-room, among the starched
sofa-tidies and pink shells that testified to the family
prosperity, Justine shone with enjoyment and sympathy.
She had always taken an interest in the lives
and thoughts of working-people: not so much the
constructive interest of the sociological mind as the
vivid imaginative concern of a heart open to every
human appeal. She liked to hear about their hard
struggles and small pathetic successes: the children's
sicknesses, the father's lucky job, the little sum they
had been able to put by, the plans they had formed for
Tommy's advancement, and how Sue's good marks at
school were still ahead of Mrs. Hagan's Mary's.</p>

<p>"What I really like is to gossip with them, and give
them advice about the baby's cough, and the cheapest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[p 458]</a></span>
way to do their marketing," she said laughing, as she
and Amherst emerged once more into the street. "It's
the same kind of interest I used to feel in my dolls and
guinea pigs&mdash;a managing, interfering old maid's interest.
I don't believe I should care a straw for them
if I couldn't dose them and order them about."</p>

<p>Amherst laughed too: he recalled the time when he
had dreamed that just such warm personal sympathy
was her sex's destined contribution to the broad work
of human beneficence. Well, it had not been a dream:
here was a woman whose deeds spoke for her. And
suddenly the thought came to him: what might they
not do at Westmore together! The brightness of it
was blinding&mdash;like the dazzle of sunlight which faced
them as they walked toward the mills. But it left him
speechless, confused&mdash;glad to have a pretext for routing
Duplain out of the office, introducing him to Miss
Brent, and asking him for the keys of the buildings....</p>

<p>It was wonderful, again, how she grasped what he
was doing in the mills, and saw how his whole scheme
hung together, harmonizing the work and leisure of the
operatives, instead of treating them as half machine,
half man, and neglecting the man for the machine.
Nor was she content with Utopian generalities: she
wanted to know the how and why of each case, to hear
what conclusions he drew from his results, to what
solutions his experiments pointed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[p 459]</a></span></p>

<p>In explaining the mill work he forgot his constraint
and returned to the free comradery of mind that had
always marked their relation. He turned the key reluctantly
in the last door, and paused a moment on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Anything more?" he said, with a laugh meant to
hide his desire to prolong their tour.</p>

<p>She glanced up at the sun, which still swung free of
the tall factory roofs.</p>

<p>"As much as you've time for. Cicely doesn't need
me this afternoon, and I can't tell when I shall see
Westmore again."</p>

<p>Her words fell on him with a chill. His smile faded,
and he looked away for a moment.</p>

<p>"But I hope Cicely will be here often," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so too," she rejoined, with seeming unconsciousness
of any connection between the wish and
her previous words.</p>

<p>Amherst hesitated. He had meant to propose a visit
to the old Eldorado building, which now at last housed
the long-desired night-schools and nursery; but since
she had spoken he felt a sudden indifference to showing
her anything more. What was the use, if she
meant to leave Cicely, and drift out of his reach? He
could get on well enough without sympathy and comprehension,
but his momentary indulgence in them
made the ordinary taste of life a little flat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[p 460]</a></span></p>

<p>"There must be more to see?" she continued, as they
turned back toward the village; and he answered absently:
"Oh, yes&mdash;if you like."</p>

<p>He heard the change in his own voice, and knew by
her quick side-glance that she had heard it too.</p>

<p>"Please let me see everything that is compatible with
my getting a car to Hanaford by six."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;the night-school next," he said with an
effort at lightness; and to shake off the importunity of
his own thoughts he added carelessly, as they walked
on: "By the way&mdash;it seems improbable&mdash;but I think I
saw Dr. Wyant yesterday in a Westmore car."</p>

<p>She echoed the name in surprise. "Dr. Wyant?
Really! Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Not quite; but if it wasn't he it was his ghost.
You haven't heard of his being at Hanaford?"</p>

<p>"No. I've heard nothing of him for ages."</p>

<p>Something in her tone made him return her side-glance;
but her voice, on closer analysis, denoted only
indifference, and her profile seemed to express the same
negative sentiment. He remembered a vague Lynbrook
rumour to the effect that the young doctor had
been attracted to Miss Brent. Such floating seeds
of gossip seldom rooted themselves in his mind, but
now the fact acquired a new significance, and he wondered
how he could have thought so little of it at the
time. Probably her somewhat exaggerated air of in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[p 461]</a></span>difference
simply meant that she had been bored by
Wyant's attentions, and that the reminder of them
still roused a slight self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Amherst was relieved by this conclusion, and murmuring:
"Oh, I suppose it can't have been he," led
her rapidly on to the Eldorado. But the old sense of
free communion was again obstructed, and her interest
in the details of the schools and nursery now seemed
to him only a part of her wonderful art of absorbing
herself in other people's affairs. He was a fool to have
been duped by it&mdash;to have fancied it was anything
more personal than a grace of manner.</p>

<p>As she turned away from inspecting the blackboards
in one of the empty school-rooms he paused before her
and said suddenly: "You spoke of not seeing Westmore
again. Are you thinking of leaving Cicely?"</p>

<p>The words were almost the opposite of those he had
intended to speak; it was as if some irrepressible inner
conviction flung defiance at his surface distrust of her.</p>

<p>She stood still also, and he saw a thought move
across her face. "Not immediately&mdash;but perhaps when
Mr. Langhope can make some other arrangement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Owing to the half-holiday they had the school-building
to themselves, and the fact of being alone
with her, without fear of interruption, woke in Amherst
an uncontrollable longing to taste for once the
joy of unguarded utterance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[p 462]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you go?" he asked, moving close to the
platform on which she stood.</p>

<p>She hesitated, resting her hand on the teacher's desk.
Her eyes were kind, but he thought her tone was cold.</p>

<p>"This easy life is rather out of my line," she said at
length, with a smile that draped her words in vagueness.</p>

<p>Amherst looked at her again&mdash;she seemed to be
growing remote and inaccessible. "You mean that you
don't want to stay?"</p>

<p>His tone was so abrupt that it called forth one of
her rare blushes. "No&mdash;not that. I have been very
happy with Cicely&mdash;but soon I shall have to be doing
something else."</p>

<p>Why was she blushing? And what did her last
phrase mean? "Something else&mdash;?" The blood
hummed in his ears&mdash;he began to hope she would
not answer too quickly.</p>

<p>She had sunk into the seat behind the desk, propping
her elbows on its lid, and letting her interlaced hands
support her chin. A little bunch of violets which had
been thrust into the folds of her dress detached itself
and fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"What I mean is," she said in a low voice, raising
her eyes to Amherst's, "that I've had a great desire
lately to get back to real work&mdash;my special work....
I've been too idle for the last year&mdash;I want to do some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[p 463]</a></span>
hard nursing; I want to help people who are miserable."</p>

<p>She spoke earnestly, almost passionately, and as he
listened his undefined fear was lifted. He had never
before seen her in this mood, with brooding brows, and
the darkness of the world's pain in her eyes. All her
glow had faded&mdash;she was a dun thrush-like creature,
clothed in semi-tints; yet she seemed much nearer
than when her smile shot light on him.</p>

<p>He stood motionless, his eyes absently fixed on the
bunch of violets at her feet. Suddenly he raised his
head, and broke out with a boyish blush: "Could it
have been Wyant who was trying to see you?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Wyant&mdash;trying to see me?" She lowered her
hands to the desk, and sat looking at him with open
wonder.</p>

<p>He saw the irrelevance of his question, and burst,
in spite of himself, into youthful laughter.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;It's only that an unknown visitor called
at the house yesterday, and insisted that you must have
arrived. He seemed so annoyed at not finding you,
that I thought...I imagined...it must be some one
who knew you very well...and who had followed you
here...for some special reason...."</p>

<p>Her colour rose again, as if caught from his; but
her eyes still declared her ignorance. "Some special
reason&mdash;&mdash;?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[p 464]</a></span></p>

<p>"And just now," he blurted out, "when you said you
might not stay much longer with Cicely&mdash;I thought of
the visit&mdash;and wondered if there was some one you
meant to marry...."</p>

<p>A silence fell between them. Justine rose slowly, her
eyes screened under the veil she had lowered. "No&mdash;I
don't mean to marry," she said, half-smiling, as she
came down from the platform.</p>

<p>Restored to his level, her small shadowy head just in
a line with his eyes, she seemed closer, more approachable
and feminine&mdash;yet Amherst did not dare to speak.</p>

<p>She took a few steps toward the window, looking out
into the deserted street. "It's growing dark&mdash;I must
go home," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented absently as he followed her. He
had no idea what she was saying. The inner voices
in which they habitually spoke were growing louder
than outward words. Or was it only the voice of his
own desires that he heard&mdash;the cry of new hopes and
unguessed capacities of living? All within him was
flood-tide: this was the top of life, surely&mdash;to feel her
alike in his brain and his pulses, to steep sight and
hearing in the joy of her nearness, while all the while
thought spoke clear: "This is the mate of my mind."</p>

<p>He began again abruptly. "Wouldn't you marry,
if it gave you the chance to do what you say&mdash;if it
offered you hard work, and the opportunity to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[p 465]</a></span>
things better...for a great many people...as no
one but yourself could do it?"</p>

<p>It was a strange way of putting his case: he was
aware of it before he ended. But it had not occurred
to him to tell her that she was lovely and desirable&mdash;in
his humility he thought that what he had to give
would plead for him better than what he was.</p>

<p>The effect produced on her by his question, though
undecipherable, was extraordinary. She stiffened a
little, remaining quite motionless, her eyes on the street.</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" she just breathed; and he saw that she was
beginning to tremble.</p>

<p>His wooing had been harsh and clumsy&mdash;he was
afraid it had offended her, and his hand trembled too
as it sought hers.</p>

<p>"I only thought&mdash;it would be a dull business to most
women&mdash;and I'm tied to it for life...but I thought...I've
seen so often how you pity suffering...how
you long to relieve it...."</p>

<p>She turned away from him with a shuddering sigh.
"Oh, I <i>hate</i> suffering!" she broke out, raising her
hands to her face.</p>

<p>Amherst was frightened. How senseless of him to
go on reiterating the old plea! He ought to have
pleaded for himself&mdash;to have let the man in him seek
her and take his defeat, instead of beating about the
flimsy bush of philanthropy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[p 466]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only meant&mdash;I was trying to make my work recommend
me..." he said with a half-laugh, as she
remained silent, her eyes still turned away.</p>

<p>The silence continued for a long time&mdash;it stretched
between them like a narrowing interminable road, down
which, with a leaden heart, he seemed to watch her
gradually disappearing. And then, unexpectedly, as
she shrank to a tiny speck at the dip of the road, the
perspective was mysteriously reversed, and he felt her
growing nearer again, felt her close to him&mdash;felt her
hand in his.</p>

<p>"I'm really just like other women, you know&mdash;I
shall like it because it's your work," she said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one agreed that, on the whole, Mr. Langhope
had behaved extremely well.</p>

<p>He was just beginning to regain his equanimity in
the matter of the will&mdash;to perceive that, in the eyes of
the public, something important and distinguished was
being done at Westmore, and that the venture, while
reducing Cicely's income during her minority, might,
in some incredible way, actually make for its ultimate
increase. So much Mr. Langhope, always eager to
take the easiest view of the inevitable, had begun to
let fall in his confidential comments on Amherst; when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[p 467]</a></span>
his newly-regained balance was rudely shaken by the
news of his son-in-law's marriage.</p>

<p>The free expression of his anger was baffled by the
fact that, even by the farthest stretch of self-extenuating
logic, he could find no one to blame for the event but
himself.</p>

<p>"Why on earth don't you say so&mdash;don't you call me
a triple-dyed fool for bringing them together?" he
challenged Mrs. Ansell, as they had the matter out together
in the small intimate drawing-room of her New
York apartment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, stirring her tea with a pensive hand,
met the challenge composedly.</p>

<p>"At present you're doing it for me," she reminded him;
"and after all, I'm not so disposed to agree with you."</p>

<p>"Not agree with me? But you told me not to engage
Miss Brent! Didn't you tell me not to engage her?"</p>

<p>She made a hesitating motion of assent.</p>

<p>"But, good Lord, how was I to help myself? No
man was ever in such a quandary!" he broke off, leaping
back to the other side of the argument.</p>

<p>"No," she said, looking up at him suddenly. "I
believe that, for the only time in your life, you were
sorry then that you hadn't married me."</p>

<p>She held his eyes for a moment with a look of gentle
malice; then he laughed, and drew forth his cigarette-case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[p 468]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, come&mdash;you've inverted the formula," he said,
reaching out for the enamelled match-box at his elbow.
She let the pleasantry pass with a slight smile, and he
went on reverting to his grievance: "Why <i>didn't</i> you
want me to engage Miss Brent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know...some instinct."</p>

<p>"You won't tell me?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't if I tried; and now, after all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After all&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>She reflected. "You'll have Cicely off your mind, I
mean."</p>

<p>"Cicely off my mind?" Mr. Langhope was beginning
to find his charming friend less consolatory than
usual. After all, the most magnanimous woman has
her circuitous way of saying <i>I told you so</i>. "As if any
good governess couldn't have done that for me!" he
grumbled.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;the present care for her. But I was looking
ahead," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"To what&mdash;if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"The next few years&mdash;when Mrs. Amherst may have
children of her own."</p>

<p>"Children of her own?" He bounded up, furious
at the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Had it never occurred to you?"</p>

<p>"Hardly as a source of consolation!"</p>

<p>"I think a philosophic mind might find it so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[p 469]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should really be interested to know how!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell put down her cup, and again turned her
gentle tolerant eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Amherst, as a father, will take a more conservative
view of his duties. Every one agrees that, in
spite of his theories, he has a good head for business;
and whatever he does at Westmore for the advantage
of his children will naturally be for Cicely's advantage
too."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope returned her gaze thoughtfully.
"There's something in what you say," he admitted
after a pause. "But it doesn't alter the fact that, with
Amherst unmarried, the whole of the Westmore fortune
would have gone back to Cicely&mdash;where it belongs."</p>

<p>"Possibly. But it was so unlikely that he would
remain unmarried."</p>

<p>"I don't see why! A man of honour would have felt
bound to keep the money for Cicely."</p>

<p>"But you must remember that, from Mr. Amherst's
standpoint, the money belongs rather to Westmore than
to Cicely."</p>

<p>"He's no better than a socialist, then!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;supposing he isn't: the birth of a son and
heir will cure that."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope winced, but she persisted gently: "It's
really safer for Cicely as it is&mdash;" and before the end of
the conference he found himself confessing, half against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[p 470]</a></span>
his will: "Well, since he hadn't the decency to remain
single, I'm thankful he hasn't inflicted a stranger on us;
and I shall never forget what Miss Brent did for my
poor Bessy...."</p>

<p>It was the view she had wished to bring him to, and
the view which, in due course, with all his accustomed
grace and adaptability, he presented to the searching
gaze of a society profoundly moved by the incident of
Amherst's marriage. "Of course, if Mr. Langhope
approves&mdash;" society reluctantly murmured; and that
Mr. Langhope did approve was presently made manifest
by every outward show of consideration toward the
newly-wedded couple.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Amherst and Justine had been married in September;
and after a holiday in Canada and the Adirondacks
they returned to Hanaford for the winter. Amherst
had proposed a short flight to Europe; but his wife
preferred to settle down at once to her new duties.</p>

<p>The announcement of her marriage had been met by
Mrs. Dressel with a comment which often afterward
returned to her memory. "It's splendid for you, of
course, dear, <i>in one way</i>," her friend had murmured,
between disparagement and envy&mdash;"that is, if you can
stand talking about the Westmore mill-hands all the
rest of your life."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't&mdash;I should hate it!" Justine had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[p 471]</a></span>
energetically rejoined; meeting Mrs. Dressel's admonitory
"Well, then?" with the laughing assurance that
<i>she</i> meant to lead the conversation.</p>

<p>She knew well enough what the admonition meant.
To Amherst, so long thwarted in his chosen work, the
subject of Westmore was becoming an <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>; and
it was natural that Hanaford should class him as a man
of one topic. But Justine had guessed at his other
side; a side as long thwarted, and far less articulate,
which she intended to wake into life. She had felt
it in him from the first, though their talks had so uniformly
turned on the subject which palled on Hanaford;
and it had been revealed to her during the silent
hours among his books, when she had grown into
such close intimacy with his mind.</p>

<p>She did not, assuredly, mean to spend the rest of her
days talking about the Westmore mill-hands; but in
the arrogance of her joy she wished to begin her married
life in the setting of its habitual duties, and to achieve
the victory of evoking the secret unsuspected Amherst
out of the preoccupied business man chained to his task.
Dull lovers might have to call on romantic scenes to
wake romantic feelings; but Justine's glancing imagination
leapt to the challenge of extracting poetry from the
prose of routine.</p>

<p>And this was precisely the triumph that the first
months brought her. To mortal eye, Amherst and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[p 472]</a></span>
Justine seemed to be living at Hanaford: in reality
they were voyaging on unmapped seas of adventure.
The seas were limitless, and studded with happy islands:
every fresh discovery they made about each other,
every new agreement of ideas and feelings, offered itself
to these intrepid explorers as a friendly coast where
they might beach their keel and take their bearings.
Thus, in the thronging hum of metaphor, Justine sometimes
pictured their relation; seeing it, again, as a
journey through crowded populous cities, where every
face she met was Amherst's; or, contrarily, as a
multiplication of points of perception, so that one
became, for the world's contact, a surface so multitudinously
alive that the old myth of hearing the
grass grow and walking the rainbow explained itself
as the heightening of personality to the utmost pitch
of sympathy.</p>

<p>In reality, the work at Westmore became an almost
necessary sedative after these flights into the blue. She
felt sometimes that they would have been bankrupted
of sensations if daily hours of drudgery had not provided
a reservoir in which fresh powers of enjoyment
could slowly gather. And their duties had the rarer
quality of constituting, precisely, the deepest, finest
bond between them, the clarifying element which saved
their happiness from stagnation, and kept it in the
strong mid-current of human feeling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[p 473]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this element in their affection which, in the
last days of November, was unexpectedly put on trial.
Mr. Langhope, since his return from his annual visit to
Europe, showed signs of diminishing strength and
elasticity. He had had to give up his nightly dinner
parties, to desert his stall at the Opera: to take, in
short, as he plaintively put it, his social pleasures hom&#339;opathically.
Certain of his friends explained the
change by saying that he had never been "quite the
same" since his daughter's death; while others found
its determining cause in the shock of Amherst's second
marriage. But this insinuation Mr. Langhope in due
time discredited by writing to ask the Amhersts if they
would not pity his loneliness and spend the winter in
town with him. The proposal came in a letter to Justine,
which she handed to her husband one afternoon
on his return from the mills.</p>

<p>She sat behind the tea-table in the Westmore drawing-room,
now at last transformed, not into Mrs.
Dressel's vision of "something lovely in Louis Seize,"
but into a warm yet sober setting for books, for scattered
flowers, for deep chairs and shaded lamps in
pleasant nearness to each other.</p>

<p>Amherst raised his eyes from the letter, thinking as
he did so how well her bright head, with its flame-like
play of meanings, fitted into the background she had
made for it. Still unobservant of external details, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[p 474]</a></span>
was beginning to feel a vague well-being of the eye
wherever her touch had passed.</p>

<p>"Well, we must do it," he said simply.</p>

<p>"Oh, must we?" she murmured, holding out his
cup.</p>

<p>He smiled at her note of dejection. "Unnatural
woman! New York <i>versus</i> Hanaford&mdash;do you really
dislike it so much?"</p>

<p>She tried to bring a tone of consent into her voice.
"I shall be very glad to be with Cicely again&mdash;and that,
of course," she reflected, "is the reason why Mr. Langhope
wants us."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if it is, it's a good reason."</p>

<p>"Yes. But how much shall you be with us?"</p>

<p>"If you say so, I'll arrange to get away for a month
or two."</p>

<p>"Oh, no: I don't want that!" she said, with a smile
that triumphed a little. "But why should not Cicely
come here?"</p>

<p>"If Mr. Langhope is cut off from his usual amusements,
I'm afraid that would only make him more
lonely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so." She put aside her untasted
cup, resting her elbows on her knees, and her chin on
her clasped hands, in the attitude habitual to her in
moments of inward debate.</p>

<p>Amherst rose and seated himself on the sofa beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[p 475]</a></span>
her. "Dear! What is it?" he said, drawing her hands
down, so that she had to turn her face to his.</p>

<p>"Nothing...I don't know...a superstition. I've
been so happy here!"</p>

<p>"Is our happiness too perishable to be transplanted?"</p>

<p>She smiled and answered by another question. "You
don't mind doing it, then?"</p>

<p>Amherst hesitated. "Shall I tell you? I feel that
it's a sort of ring of Polycrates. It may buy off the
jealous gods."</p>

<p>A faint shrinking from some importunate suggestion
seemed to press her closer to him. "Then you feel
they <i>are</i> jealous?" she breathed, in a half-laugh.</p>

<p>"I pity them if they're not!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed, rallying to his tone. "I only had
a fancy that they might overlook such a dull place as
Hanaford."</p>

<p>Amherst drew her to him. "Isn't it, on the contrary,
in the ash-heaps that the rag-pickers prowl?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was no disguising it: she was growing afraid
of her happiness. Her husband's analogy of the ring
expressed her fear. She seemed to herself to carry a
blazing jewel on her breast&mdash;something that singled
her out for human envy and divine pursuit. She had
a preposterous longing to dress plainly and shabbily,
to subdue her voice and gestures, to try to slip through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[p 476]</a></span>
life unnoticed; yet all the while she knew that her jewel
would shoot its rays through every disguise. And from
the depths of ancient atavistic instincts came the hope
that Amherst was right&mdash;that by sacrificing their
precious solitude to Mr. Langhope's convenience they
might still deceive the gods.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Once pledged to her new task, Justine, as usual, espoused
it with ardour. It was pleasant, even among
greater joys, to see her husband again frankly welcomed
by Mr. Langhope; to see Cicely bloom into
happiness at their coming; and to overhear Mr. Langhope
exclaim, in a confidential aside to his son-in-law:
"It's wonderful, the <i>bien-&ecirc;tre</i> that wife of yours diffuses
about her!"</p>

<p>The element of <i>bien-&ecirc;tre</i> was the only one in which
Mr. Langhope could draw breath; and to those who
kept him immersed in it he was prodigal of delicate
attentions. The experiment, in short, was a complete
success; and even Amherst's necessary weeks at Hanaford
had the merit of giving a finer flavour to his brief
appearances.</p>

<p>Of all this Justine was thinking as she drove down
Fifth Avenue one January afternoon to meet her husband
at the Grand Central station. She had tamed
her happiness at last: the quality of fear had left it,
and it nestled in her heart like some wild creature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[p 477]</a></span>
subdued to human ways. And, as her inward bliss
became more and more a quiet habit of the mind, the
longing to help and minister returned, absorbing her
more deeply in her husband's work.</p>

<p>She dismissed the carriage at the station, and when
his train had arrived they emerged together into the
cold winter twilight and turned up Madison Avenue.
These walks home from the station gave them a little
more time to themselves than if they had driven; and
there was always so much to tell on both sides. This
time the news was all good: the work at Westmore was
prospering, and on Justine's side there was a more
cheerful report of Mr. Langhope's health, and&mdash;best
of all&mdash;his promise to give them Cicely for the summer.
Amherst and Justine were both anxious that the child
should spend more time at Hanaford, that her young
associations should begin to gather about Westmore;
and Justine exulted in the fact that the suggestion had
come from Mr. Langhope himself, while she and Amherst
were still planning how to lead him up to it.</p>

<p>They reached the house while this triumph was still
engaging them; and in the doorway Amherst turned to
her with a smile.</p>

<p>"And of course&mdash;dear man!&mdash;he believes the idea is
all his. There's nothing you can't make people believe,
you little Jesuit!"</p>

<p>"I don't think there is!" she boasted, falling gaily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[p 478]</a></span>
into his tone; and then, as the door opened, and she
entered the hall, her eyes fell on a blotted envelope
which lay among the letters on the table.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid proffered it with a word of explanation.
"A gentleman left it for you, madam; he
asked to see you, and said he'd call for the answer in a
day or two."</p>

<p>"Another begging letter, I suppose," said Amherst,
turning into the drawing-room, where Mr. Langhope
and Cicely awaited them; and Justine, carelessly pushing
the envelope into her muff, murmured "I suppose
so" as she followed him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXXIII" id="XXXIII"></a>XXXIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the tea-table Justine forgot the note in
her muff; but when she went upstairs to dress
it fell to the floor, and she picked it up and laid it on
her dressing-table.</p>

<p>She had already recognized the hand as Wyant's,
for it was not the first letter she had received from him.</p>

<p>Three times since her marriage he had appealed to
her for help, excusing himself on the plea of difficulties
and ill-health. The first time he wrote, he alluded
vaguely to having married, and to being compelled,
through illness, to give up his practice at Clifton. On
receiving this letter she made enquiries, and learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[p 479]</a></span>
that, a month or two after her departure from Lynbrook,
Wyant had married a Clifton girl&mdash;a pretty
piece of flaunting innocence, whom she remembered
about the lanes, generally with a young man in a buggy.
There had evidently been something obscure and precipitate
about the marriage, which was a strange one
for the ambitious young doctor. Justine conjectured
that it might have been the cause of his leaving Clifton&mdash;or
or perhaps he had already succumbed to the fatal
habit she had suspected in him. At any rate he seemed,
in some mysterious way, to have dropped in two years
from promise to failure; yet she could not believe that,
with his talents, and the name he had begun to make,
such a lapse could be more than temporary. She had
often heard Dr. Garford prophesy great things for him;
but Dr. Garford had died suddenly during the previous
summer, and the loss of this powerful friend was mentioned
by Wyant among his misfortunes.</p>

<p>Justine was anxious to help him, but her marriage
to a rich man had not given her the command of much
money. She and Amherst, choosing to regard themselves
as pensioners on the Westmore fortune, were
scrupulous in restricting their personal expenditure;
and her work among the mill-hands brought many demands
on the modest allowance which her husband had
insisted on her accepting. In reply to Wyant's first
appeal, which reached her soon after her marriage, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[p 480]</a></span>
had sent him a hundred dollars; but when the second
came, some two months later&mdash;with a fresh tale of ill-luck
and ill-health&mdash;she had not been able to muster
more than half the amount. Finally a third letter had
arrived, a short time before their leaving for New York.
It told the same story of persistent misfortune, but on
this occasion Wyant, instead of making a direct appeal
for money, suggested that, through her hospital connections,
she should help him to establish a New York
practice. His tone was half-whining, half-peremptory,
his once precise writing smeared and illegible; and
these indications, combined with her former suspicions,
convinced her that, for the moment, he was unfit for
medical work. At any rate, she could not assume the
responsibility of recommending him; and in answering
she advised him to apply to some of the physicians he
had worked with at Lynbrook, softening her refusal by
the enclosure of a small sum of money. To this letter
she received no answer. Wyant doubtless found the
money insufficient, and resented her unwillingness to
help him by the use of her influence; and she felt sure
that the note before her contained a renewal of his
former request.</p>

<p>An obscure reluctance made her begin to undress
before opening it. She felt slightly tired and indolently
happy, and she did not wish any jarring impression to
break in on the sense of completeness which her hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[p 481]</a></span>band's
coming always put into her life. Her happiness
was making her timid and luxurious: she was beginning
to shrink from even trivial annoyances.</p>

<p>But when at length, in her dressing-gown, her loosened
hair about her shoulders, she seated herself before the
toilet-mirror, Wyant's note once more confronted her.
It was absurd to put off reading it&mdash;if he asked for
money again, she would simply confide the whole business
to Amherst.</p>

<p>She had never spoken to her husband of her correspondence
with Wyant. The mere fact that the latter
had appealed to her, instead of addressing himself to
Amherst, made her suspect that he had a weakness to
hide, and counted on her professional discretion. But
his continued importunities would certainly release her
from any such supposed obligation; and she thought
with relief of casting the weight of her difficulty on her
husband's shoulders.</p>

<p>She opened the note and read.</p>

<p>"I did not acknowledge your last letter because I
was ashamed to tell you that the money was not enough
to be of any use. But I am past shame now. My
wife was confined three weeks ago, and has been desperately
ill ever since. She is in no state to move, but
we shall be put out of these rooms unless I can get
money or work at once. A word from you would
have given me a start in New York&mdash;and I'd be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[p 482]</a></span>
willing to begin again as an interne or a doctor's
assistant.</p>

<p>"I have never reminded you of what you owe me,
and I should not do so now if I hadn't been to hell and
back since I saw you. But I suppose you would rather
have me remind you than apply to Mr. Amherst. You
can tell me when to call for my answer."</p>

<p>Justine laid down the letter and looked up. Her
eyes rested on her own reflection in the glass, and it
frightened her. She sat motionless, with a thickly-beating
heart, one hand clenched on the letter.</p>

<p><i>"I suppose you would rather have me remind you
than apply to Mr. Amherst."</i></p>

<p>That was what his importunity meant, then! She
had been paying blackmail all this time.... Somewhere,
from the first, in an obscure fold of consciousness,
she had felt the stir of an unnamed, unacknowledged
fear; and now the fear raised its head and looked
at her. Well! She would look back at it, then: look
it straight in the malignant eye. What was it, after
all, but a "bugbear to scare children"&mdash;the ghost of
the opinion of the many? She had suspected from the
first that Wyant knew of her having shortened the term
of Bessy Amherst's sufferings&mdash;returning to the room
when he did, it was almost impossible that he should
not have guessed what had happened; and his silence
had made her believe that he understood her motive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[p 483]</a></span>
and approved it. But, supposing she had been mistaken,
she still had nothing to fear, since she had done
nothing that her own conscience condemned. If the
act were to do again she would do it&mdash;she had never
known a moment's regret!</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard Amherst's step in the passage&mdash;heard
him laughing and talking as he chased Cicely up
the stairs to the nursery.</p>

<p><i>If she was not afraid, why had she never told Amherst?</i></p>

<p>Why, the answer to that was simple enough! She
had not told him <i>because she was not afraid</i>. From the
first she had retained sufficient detachment to view her
act impartially, to find it completely justified by circumstances,
and to decide that, since those circumstances
could be but partly and indirectly known to her
husband, she not only had the right to keep her own
counsel, but was actually under a kind of obligation
not to force on him the knowledge of a fact that he
could not alter and could not completely judge....
Was there any flaw in this line of reasoning? Did it
not show a deliberate weighing of conditions, a perfect
rectitude of intention? And, after all, she had had
Amherst's virtual consent to her act! She knew his
feelings on such matters&mdash;his independence of traditional
judgments, his horror of inflicting needless pain&mdash;she
was as sure of his intellectual assent as of her own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[p 484]</a></span>
She was even sure that, when she told him, he would
appreciate her reasons for not telling him before....</p>

<p>For now of course he must know everything&mdash;this
horrible letter made it inevitable. She regretted that
she had decided, though for the best of reasons, not to
speak to him of her own accord; for it was intolerable
that he should think of any external pressure as having
brought her to avowal. But no! he would not think
that. The understanding between them was so complete
that no deceptive array of circumstances could
ever make her motives obscure to him. She let herself
rest a moment in the thought....</p>

<p>Presently she heard him moving in the next room&mdash;he
had come back to dress for dinner. She would go
to him now, at once&mdash;she could not bear this weight on
her mind the whole evening. She pushed back her
chair, crumpling the letter in her hand; but as she did
so, her eyes again fell on her reflection. She could not
go to her husband with such a face! If she was not
afraid, why did she look like that?</p>

<p>Well&mdash;she was afraid! It would be easier and simpler
to admit it. She was afraid&mdash;afraid for the first
time&mdash;afraid for her own happiness! She had had just
eight months of happiness&mdash;it was horrible to think of
losing it so soon.... Losing it? But why should she
lose it? The letter must have affected her brain...all
her thoughts were in a blur of fear.... Fear of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[p 485]</a></span>
what? Of the man who understood her as no one
else understood her? The man to whose wisdom and
mercy she trusted as the believer trusts in God? This
was a kind of abominable nightmare&mdash;even Amherst's
image had been distorted in her mind! The only way
to clear her brain, to recover the normal sense of things,
was to go to him now, at once, to feel his arms about
her, to let his kiss dispel her fears.... She rose with
a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>She had to cross the length of the room to reach his
door, and when she had gone half-way she heard him
knock.</p>

<p>"May I come in?"</p>

<p>She was close to the fire-place, and a bright fire
burned on the hearth.</p>

<p>"Come in!" she answered; and as she did so, she
turned and dropped Wyant's letter into the fire. Her
hand had crushed it into a little ball, and she saw the
flames spring up and swallow it before her husband
entered.</p>

<p>It was not that she had changed her mind&mdash;she still
meant to tell him everything. But to hold the letter
was like holding a venomous snake&mdash;she wanted to
exterminate it, to forget that she had ever seen the
blotted repulsive characters. And she could not bear
to have Amherst's eyes rest on it, to have him know
that any man had dared to write to her in that tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[p 486]</a></span>
What vile meanings might not be read between Wyant's
phrases? She had a right to tell the story in her own
way&mdash;the true way....</p>

<p>As Amherst approached, in his evening clothes, the
heavy locks smoothed from his forehead, a flower of
Cicely's giving in his button-hole, she thought she had
never seen him look so kind and handsome.</p>

<p>"Not dressed? Do you know that it's ten minutes
to eight?" he said, coming up to her with a smile.</p>

<p>She roused herself, putting her hands to her hair.
"Yes, I know&mdash;I forgot," she murmured, longing to
feel his arms about her, but standing rooted to the
ground, unable to move an inch nearer.</p>

<p>It was he who came close, drawing her lifted hands
into his. "You look worried&mdash;I hope it was nothing
troublesome that made you forget?"</p>

<p>The divine kindness in his voice, his eyes! Yes&mdash;it
would be easy, quite easy, to tell him....</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;I was a little troubled...." she said,
feeling the warmth of his touch flow through her hands
reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Dear! What about?"</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath. "The letter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. "What letter?"</p>

<p>"Downstairs...when we came in...it was not an
ordinary begging-letter."</p>

<p>"No? What then?" he asked, his face clouding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[p 487]</a></span></p>

<p>She noticed the change, and it frightened her. Was
he angry? Was he going to be angry? But how
absurd! He was only distressed at her distress.</p>

<p>"What then?" he repeated, more gently.</p>

<p>She looked up into his eyes for an instant. "It was
a horrible letter&mdash;&mdash;" she whispered, as she pressed her
clasped hands against him.</p>

<p>His grasp tightened on her wrists, and again the stern
look crossed his face. "Horrible? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>She had never seen him angry&mdash;but she felt suddenly
that, to the guilty creature, his anger would be terrible.
He would crush Wyant&mdash;she must be careful how she
spoke.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that&mdash;only painful...."</p>

<p>"Where is the letter? Let me see it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no" she exclaimed, shrinking away.</p>

<p>"Justine, what has happened? What ails you?"</p>

<p>On a blind impulse she had backed toward the
hearth, propping her arms against the mantel-piece
while she stole a secret glance at the embers. Nothing
remained of it&mdash;no, nothing.</p>

<p>But suppose it was against herself that his anger
turned? The idea was preposterous, yet she trembled
at it. It was clear that she must say <i>something</i> at
once&mdash;must somehow account for her agitation. But
the sense that she was unnerved&mdash;no longer in control
of her face, her voice&mdash;made her feel that she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[p 488]</a></span>
tell her story badly if she told it now.... Had she not
the right to gain a respite, to choose her own hour?
Weakness&mdash;weakness again! Every delay would only
increase the phantom terror. Now, <i>now</i>&mdash;with her
head on his breast!</p>

<p>She turned toward him and began to speak impulsively.</p>

<p>"I can't show you the letter, because it's not&mdash;not
my secret&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah?" he murmured, perceptibly relieved.</p>

<p>"It's from some one&mdash;unlucky&mdash;whom I've known
about...."</p>

<p>"And whose troubles have been troubling you? But
can't we help?"</p>

<p>She shone on him through gleaming lashes. "Some
one poor and ill&mdash;who needs money, I mean&mdash;&mdash;" She
tried to laugh away her tears. "And I haven't any!
That's <i>my</i> trouble!"</p>

<p>"Foolish child! And to beg you are ashamed? And
so you're letting your tears cool Mr. Langhope's soup?"
He had her in his arms now, his kisses drying her
cheek; and she turned her head so that their lips met
in a long pressure.</p>

<p>"Will a hundred dollars do?" he asked with a smile
as he released her.</p>

<p><i>A hundred dollars!</i> No&mdash;she was almost sure they
would not. But she tried to shape a murmur of gratitude.
"Thank you&mdash;thank you! I hated to ask...."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[p 489]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll write the cheque at once."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," she protested, "there's no hurry."</p>

<p>But he went back to his room, and she turned again
to the toilet-table. Her face was painful to look at
still&mdash;but a light was breaking through its fear. She
felt the touch of a narcotic in her veins. How calm
and peaceful the room was&mdash;and how delicious to
think that her life would go on in it, safely and peacefully,
in the old familiar way!</p>

<p>As she swept up her hair, passing the comb through
it, and flinging it dexterously over her lifted wrist, she
heard Amherst cross the floor behind her, and pause to
lay something on her writing-table.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she murmured again, lowering her
head as he passed.</p>

<p>When the door had closed on him she thrust the last
pin into her hair, dashed some drops of Cologne on her
face, and went over to the writing-table. As she picked
up the cheque she saw it was for three hundred dollars.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIV" id="XXXIV"></a>XXXIV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> or twice, in the days that followed, Justine
found herself thinking that she had never
known happiness before. The old state of secure well-being
seemed now like a dreamless sleep; but this new
bliss, on its sharp pinnacle ringed with fire&mdash;this thrill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[p 490]</a></span>ing
conscious joy, daily and hourly snatched from fear&mdash;this
was living, not sleeping!</p>

<p>Wyant acknowledged her gift with profuse, almost
servile thanks. She had sent it without a word&mdash;saying
to herself that pity for his situation made it possible
to ignore his baseness. And the days went on as
before. She was not conscious of any change, save in
the heightened, almost artificial quality of her happiness,
till one day in March, when Mr. Langhope announced
that he was going for two or three weeks to
a friend's shooting-box in the south. The anniversary
of Bessy's death was approaching, and Justine knew
that at that time he always absented himself.</p>

<p>"Supposing you and Amherst were to carry off Cicely
till I come back? Perhaps you could persuade him to
break away from work for once&mdash;or, if that's impossible,
you could take her with you to Hanaford. She looks
a little pale, and the change would be good for her."</p>

<p>This was a great concession on Mr. Langhope's
part, and Justine saw the pleasure in her husband's
face. It was the first time that his father-in-law had
suggested Cicely's going to Hanaford.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't break away just now, sir," Amherst
said, "but it will be delightful for Justine if
you'll give us Cicely while you're away."</p>

<p>"Take her by all means, my dear fellow: I always
sleep on both ears when she's with your wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[p 491]</a></span></p>

<p>It was nearly three months since Justine had left
Hanaford&mdash;and now she was to return there alone with
her husband! There would be hours, of course, when
the child's presence was between them&mdash;or when, again,
his work would keep him at the mills. But in the
evenings, when Cicely was in bed&mdash;when he and she
sat alone, together in the Westmore drawing-room&mdash;in
Bessy's drawing-room!... No&mdash;she must find some
excuse for remaining away till she had again grown
used to the idea of being alone with Amherst. Every
day she was growing a little more used to it; but it
would take time&mdash;time, and the full assurance that
Wyant was silenced. Till then she could not go back
to Hanaford.</p>

<p>She found a pretext in her own health. She pleaded
that she was a little tired, below par...and to return
to Hanaford meant returning to hard work; with the
best will in the world she could not be idle there.
Might she not, she suggested, take Cicely to Tuxedo
or Lakewood, and thus get quite away from household
cares and good works? The pretext rang hollow&mdash;it
was so unlike her! She saw Amherst's eyes rest
anxiously on her as Mr. Langhope uttered his prompt
assent. Certainly she did look tired&mdash;Mr. Langhope
himself had noticed it. Had he perhaps over-taxed
her energies, left the household too entirely on her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[p 492]</a></span>shoulders? Oh, no&mdash;it was only the New York air...like
Cicely, she pined for a breath of the woods....
And so, the day Mr. Langhope left, she and Cicely
were packed off to Lakewood.</p>

<p>They stayed there a week: then a fit of restlessness
drove Justine back to town. She found an excuse in
the constant rain&mdash;it was really useless, as she wrote
Mr. Langhope, to keep the child imprisoned in an
over-heated hotel while they could get no benefit from
the outdoor life. In reality, she found the long lonely
hours unendurable. She pined for a sight of her husband,
and thought of committing Cicely to Mrs. Ansell's
care, and making a sudden dash for Hanaford.
But the vision of the long evenings in the Westmore
drawing-room again restrained her. No&mdash;she would
simply go back to New York, dine out occasionally,
go to a concert or two, trust to the usual demands of
town life to crowd her hours with small activities....
And in another week Mr. Langhope would be back
and the days would resume their normal course.</p>

<p>On arriving, she looked feverishly through the letters
in the hall. None from Wyant&mdash;that fear was allayed!
Every day added to her reassurance. By this time, no
doubt, he was on his feet again, and ashamed&mdash;unutterably
ashamed&mdash;of the threat that despair had
wrung from him. She felt almost sure that his shame
would keep him from ever attempting to see her, or
even from writing again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[p 493]</a></span></p>

<p>"A gentleman called to see you yesterday, madam&mdash;he
would give no name," the parlour-maid said. And
there was the sick fear back on her again! She could
hardly control the trembling of her lips as she asked:
"Did he leave no message?"</p>

<p>"No, madam: he only wanted to know when you'd
be back."</p>

<p>She longed to return: "And did you tell him?"
but restrained herself, and passed into the drawing-room.
After all, the parlour-maid had not described
the caller&mdash;why jump to the conclusion that it was
Wyant?</p>

<p>Three days passed, and no letter came&mdash;no sign.
She struggled with the temptation to describe Wyant
to the servants, and to forbid his admission. But it
would not do. They were nearly all old servants, in
whose eyes she was still the intruder, the upstart sick-nurse&mdash;she
could not wholly trust them. And each
day she felt a little easier, a little more convinced that
the unknown visitor had not been Wyant.</p>

<p>On the fourth day she received a letter from Amherst.
He hoped to be back on the morrow, but as
his plans were still uncertain he would telegraph in
the morning&mdash;and meanwhile she must keep well, and
rest, and amuse herself....</p>

<p>Amuse herself! That evening, as it happened, she
was going to the theatre with Mrs. Ansell. She and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[p 494]</a></span>
Mrs. Ansell, though outwardly on perfect terms, had
not greatly advanced in intimacy. The agitated, decentralized
life of the older woman seemed futile and
trivial to Justine; but on Mr. Langhope's account
she wished to keep up an appearance of friendship with
his friend, and the same motive doubtless inspired Mrs.
Ansell. Just now, at any rate, Justine was grateful for
her attentions, and glad to go about with her. Anything&mdash;anything
to get away from her own thoughts!
That was the pass she had come to.</p>

<p>At the theatre, in a proscenium box, the publicity,
the light and movement, the action of the play, all
helped to distract and quiet her. At such moments
she grew ashamed of her fears. Why was she tormenting
herself? If anything happened she had only to
ask her husband for more money. She never spoke
to him of her good works, and there would be nothing
to excite suspicion in her asking help again for the
friend whose secret she was pledged to keep.... But
nothing was going to happen. As the play progressed,
and the stimulus of talk and laughter flowed through
her veins, she felt a complete return of confidence.
And then suddenly she glanced across the house, and
saw Wyant looking at her.</p>

<p>He sat rather far back, in one of the side rows just
beneath the balcony, so that his face was partly shaded.
But even in the shadow it frightened her. She had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[p 495]</a></span>
been prepared for a change, but not for this ghastly
deterioration. And he continued to look at her.</p>

<p>She began to be afraid that he would do something
conspicuous&mdash;point at her, or stand up in his seat.
She thought he looked half-mad&mdash;or was it her own
hallucination that made him appear so? She and Mrs.
Ansell were alone in the box for the moment, and she
started up, pushing back her chair....</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell leaned forward. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;the heat&mdash;I'll sit back for a moment."
But as she withdrew into the back of the box, she
was seized by a new fear. If he was still watching,
might he not come to the door and try to speak to
her? Her only safety lay in remaining in full view of
the audience; and she returned to Mrs. Ansell's side.</p>

<p>The other members of the party came back&mdash;the
bell rang, the foot-lights blazed, the curtain rose. She
lost herself in the mazes of the play. She sat so motionless,
her face so intently turned toward the stage,
that the muscles at the back of her neck began to
stiffen. And then, quite suddenly, toward the middle
of the act, she felt an undefinable sense of relief. She
could not tell what caused it&mdash;but slowly, cautiously,
while the eyes of the others were intent upon the stage,
she turned her head and looked toward Wyant's seat.
It was empty.</p>

<p>Her first thought was that he had gone to wait for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[p 496]</a></span>
her outside. But no&mdash;there were two more acts: why
should he stand at the door for half the evening?</p>

<p>At last the act ended; the entr'acte elapsed; the play
went on again&mdash;and still the seat was empty. Gradually
she persuaded herself that she had been mistaken
in thinking that the man who had occupied it was
Wyant. Her self-command returned, she began to
think and talk naturally, to follow the dialogue on the
stage&mdash;and when the evening was over, and Mrs. Ansell
set her down at her door, she had almost forgotten
her fears.</p>

<p>The next morning she felt calmer than for many days.
She was sure now that if Wyant had wished to speak
to her he would have waited at the door of the theatre;
and the recollection of his miserable face made apprehension
yield to pity. She began to feel that she had
treated him coldly, uncharitably. They had been
friends once, as well as fellow-workers; but she had
been false even to the comradeship of the hospital.
She should have sought him out and given him sympathy
as well as money; had she shown some sign of
human kindness his last letter might never have been
written.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning Amherst telegraphed
that he hoped to settle his business in time to catch
the two o'clock express, but that his plans were still
uncertain. Justine and Cicely lunched alone, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[p 497]</a></span>
after luncheon the little girl was despatched to her
dancing-class. Justine herself meant to go out when
the brougham returned. She went up to her room to
dress, planning to drive in the park, and to drop in on
Mrs. Ansell before she called for Cicely; but on the
way downstairs she saw the servant opening the door
to a visitor. It was too late to draw back; and descending
the last steps she found herself face to face
with Wyant.</p>

<p>They looked at each other a moment in silence; then
Justine murmured a word of greeting and led the way
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was a snowy afternoon, and in the raw ash-coloured
light she thought he looked more changed than at the
theatre. She remarked, too, that his clothes were
worn and untidy, his gloveless hands soiled and tremulous.
None of the degrading signs of his infirmity were
lacking; and she saw at once that, while in the early
days of the habit he had probably mixed his drugs, so
that the conflicting symptoms neutralized each other,
he had now sunk into open morphia-taking. She felt
profoundly sorry for him; yet as he followed her into
the room physical repulsion again mastered the sense
of pity.</p>

<p>But where action was possible she was always self-controlled,
and she turned to him quietly as they seated
themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[p 498]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been wishing to see you," she said, looking
at him. "I have felt that I ought to have done so
sooner&mdash;to have told you how sorry I am for your bad
luck."</p>

<p>He returned her glance with surprise: they were
evidently the last words he had expected.</p>

<p>"You're very kind," he said in a low embarrassed
voice. He had kept on his shabby over-coat, and he
twirled his hat in his hands as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I have felt," Justine continued, "that perhaps a
talk with you might be of more use&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He raised his head, fixing her with bright narrowed
eyes. "I have felt so too: that's my reason for coming.
You sent me a generous present some weeks ago&mdash;but
I don't want to go on living on charity."</p>

<p>"I understand that," she answered. "But why have
you had to do so? Won't you tell me just what has
happened?"</p>

<p>She felt the words to be almost a mockery; yet she
could not say "I read your history at a glance"; and
she hoped that her question might draw out his
wretched secret, and thus give her the chance to
speak frankly.</p>

<p>He gave a nervous laugh. "Just what has happened?
It's a long story&mdash;and some of the details are
not particularly pretty." He broke off, moving his hat
more rapidly through his trembling hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[p 499]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind: tell me."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;after you all left Lynbrook I had rather a
bad break-down&mdash;the strain of Mrs. Amherst's case, I
suppose. You remember Bramble, the Clifton grocer?
Miss Bramble nursed me&mdash;I daresay you remember her
too. When I recovered I married her&mdash;and after that
things didn't go well."</p>

<p>He paused, breathing quickly, and looking about the
room with odd, furtive glances. "I was only half-well,
anyhow&mdash;I couldn't attend to my patients properly&mdash;and
after a few months we decided to leave Clifton,
and I bought a practice in New Jersey. But my wife
was ill there, and things went wrong again&mdash;damnably.
I suppose you've guessed that my marriage was a mistake.
She had an idea that we should do better in
New York&mdash;so we came here a few months ago, and
we've done decidedly worse."</p>

<p>Justine listened with a sense of discouragement.
She saw now that he did not mean to acknowledge his
failing, and knowing the secretiveness of the drug-taker
she decided that he was deluded enough to think
he could still deceive her.</p>

<p>"Well," he began again, with an attempt at jauntiness,
"I've found out that in my profession it's a hard
struggle to get on your feet again, after illness or&mdash;or
any bad set-back. That's the reason I asked you to
say a word for me. It's not only the money, though I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[p 500]</a></span>
need that badly&mdash;I want to get back my self-respect.
With my record I oughtn't to be where I am&mdash;and you
can speak for me better than any one."</p>

<p>"Why better than the doctors you've worked with?"
Justine put the question abruptly, looking him straight
in the eyes.</p>

<p>His glance dropped, and an unpleasant flush rose to
his thin cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as it happens, you're better situated than
any one to help me to the particular thing I want."</p>

<p>"The particular thing&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I understand that Mr. Langhope and Mrs.
Ansell are both interested in the new wing for paying
patients at Saint Christopher's. I want the position of
house-physician there, and I know you can get it for
me."</p>

<p>His tone changed as he spoke, till with the last words
it became rough and almost menacing.</p>

<p>Justine felt her colour rise, and her heart began to
beat confusedly. Here was the truth, then: she could
no longer be the dupe of her own compassion. The
man knew his power and meant to use it. But at the
thought her courage was in arms.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;but it's impossible," she said.</p>

<p>"Impossible&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>She continued to look at him steadily. "You said
just now that you wished to regain your self-respect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[p 501]</a></span>
Well, you must regain it before you can ask me&mdash;or
any one else&mdash;to recommend you to a position of
trust."</p>

<p>Wyant half-rose, with an angry murmur. "My
self-respect? What do you mean? <i>I</i> meant that I'd
lost courage&mdash;through ill-luck&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; and your ill-luck has come through your own
fault. Till you cure yourself you're not fit to cure
others."</p>

<p>He sank back into his seat, glowering at her under
sullen brows; then his expression gradually changed
to half-sneering admiration. "You're a plucky one!"
he said.</p>

<p>Justine repressed a movement of disgust. "I am
very sorry for you," she said gravely. "I saw this
trouble coming on you long ago&mdash;and if there is any
other way in which I can help you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks," he returned, still sneering. "Your sympathy
is very precious&mdash;there was a time when I would
have given my soul for it. But that's over, and I'm
here to talk business. You say you saw my trouble
coming on&mdash;did it ever occur to you that you were the
cause of it?"</p>

<p>Justine glanced at him with frank contempt. "No&mdash;for
I was not," she replied.</p>

<p>"That's an easy way out of it. But you took everything
from me&mdash;first my hope of marrying you; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[p 502]</a></span>
my chance of a big success in my career; and I was
desperate&mdash;weak, if you like&mdash;and tried to deaden my
feelings in order to keep up my pluck."</p>

<p>Justine rose to her feet with a movement of impatience.
"Every word you say proves how unfit you
are to assume any responsibility&mdash;to do anything but
try to recover your health. If I can help you to that,
I am still willing to do so."</p>

<p>Wyant rose also, moving a step nearer. "Well, get
me that place, then&mdash;I'll see to the rest: I'll keep
straight."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it's impossible."</p>

<p>"You won't?"</p>

<p>"I can't," she repeated firmly.</p>

<p>"And you expect to put me off with that answer?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "Yes&mdash;if there's no other help you'll
accept."</p>

<p>He laughed again&mdash;his feeble sneering laugh was disgusting.
"Oh, I don't say that. I'd like to earn my
living honestly&mdash;funny preference&mdash;but if you cut me
off from that, I suppose it's only fair to let you make
up for it. My wife and child have got to live."</p>

<p>"You choose a strange way of helping them; but I
will do what I can if you will go for a while to some
institution&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke in furiously. "Institution be damned!
You can't shuffle me out of the way like that. I'm all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[p 503]</a></span>
right&mdash;good food is what I need. You think I've got
morphia in me&mdash;why, it's hunger!"</p>

<p>Justine heard him with a renewal of pity. "Oh,
I'm sorry for you&mdash;very sorry! Why do you try to
deceive me?"</p>

<p>"Why do you deceive <i>me</i>? You know what I want
and you know you've got to let me have it. If you
won't give me a line to one of your friends at Saint
Christopher's you'll have to give me another cheque&mdash;that's
the size of it."</p>

<p>As they faced each other in silence Justine's pity
gave way to a sudden hatred for the poor creature who
stood shivering and sneering before her.</p>

<p>"You choose the wrong tone&mdash;and I think our talk
has lasted long enough," she said, stretching her hand
to the bell.</p>

<p>Wyant did not move. "Don't ring&mdash;unless you want
me to write to your husband," he rejoined.</p>

<p>A sick feeling of helplessness overcame her; but she
turned on him firmly. "I pardoned you once for that
threat!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you sent me some money the next day."</p>

<p>"I was mistaken enough to think that, in your distress,
you had not realized what you wrote. But if
you're a systematic blackmailer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gently&mdash;gently. Bad names don't frighten me&mdash;it's
hunger and debt I'm afraid of."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[p 504]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine felt a last tremor of compassion. He was
abominable&mdash;but he was pitiable too.</p>

<p>"I will really help you&mdash;I will see your wife and
do what I can&mdash;but I can give you no money today."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I have none. I am not as rich as you
think."</p>

<p>He smiled incredulously. "Give me a line to Mr.
Langhope, then."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He sat down once more, leaning back with a weak
assumption of ease. "Perhaps Mr. Amherst will think
differently."</p>

<p>She whitened, but said steadily: "Mr. Amherst is
away."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;I can write."</p>

<p>For the last five minutes Justine had foreseen this
threat, and had tried to force her mind to face dispassionately
the chances it involved. After all, why
not let him write to Amherst? The very vileness of
the deed must rouse an indignation which would be
all in her favour, would inevitably dispose her husband
to readier sympathy with the motive of her act, as
contrasted with the base insinuations of her slanderer.
It seemed impossible that Amherst should condemn
her when his condemnation involved the fulfilling of
Wyant's calculations: a reaction of scorn would throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[p 505]</a></span>
him into unhesitating championship of her conduct.
All this was so clear that, had she been advising any
one else, her confidence in the course to be taken might
have strengthened the feeblest will; but with the question
lying between herself and Amherst&mdash;with the vision
of those soiled hands literally laid on the spotless fabric
of her happiness, judgment wavered, foresight was obscured&mdash;she
felt tremulously unable to face the steps
between exposure and vindication. Her final conclusion
was that she must, at any rate, gain time: buy
off Wyant till she had been able to tell her story in her
own way, and at her own hour, and then defy him
when he returned to the assault. The idea that whatever
concession she made would be only provisional,
helped to excuse the weakness of making it, and enabled
her at last, without too painful a sense of falling
below her own standards, to reply in a low voice: "If
you'll go now, I will send you something next week."</p>

<p>But Wyant did not respond as readily as she had
expected. He merely asked, without altering his insolently
easy attitude: "How much? Unless it's a
good deal, I prefer the letter."</p>

<p>Oh, why could she not cry out: "Leave the house
at once&mdash;your vulgar threats are nothing to me"&mdash;Why
could she not even say in her own heart: <i>I will
tell my husband tonight?</i></p>

<p>"You're afraid," said Wyant, as if answering her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[p 506]</a></span>
thought. "What's the use of being afraid when you
can make yourself comfortable so easily? You called
me a systematic blackmailer&mdash;well, I'm not that yet.
Give me a thousand and you'll see the last of me&mdash;on
what used to be my honour."</p>

<p>Justine's heart sank. She had reached the point of
being ready to appeal again to Amherst&mdash;but on what
pretext could she ask for such a sum?</p>

<p>In a lifeless voice she said: "I could not possibly get
more than one or two hundred."</p>

<p>Wyant scrutinized her a moment: her despair must
have rung true to him. "Well, you must have something
of your own&mdash;I saw your jewelry last night at
the theatre," he said.</p>

<p>So it had been he&mdash;and he had sat there appraising
her value like a murderer!</p>

<p>"Jewelry&mdash;?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"You had a thumping big sapphire&mdash;wasn't it?&mdash;with
diamonds round it."</p>

<p>It was her only jewel&mdash;Amherst's marriage gift. She
would have preferred a less valuable present, but his
mother had persuaded her to accept it, saying that it
was the bride's duty to adorn herself for the bridegroom.</p>

<p>"I will give you nothing&mdash;" she was about to exclaim;
when suddenly her eyes fell on the clock. If
Amherst had caught the two o'clock express he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[p 507]</a></span>
be at the house within the hour; and the only thing
that seemed of consequence now, was that he should
not meet Wyant. Supposing she still found courage
to refuse&mdash;there was no knowing how long the humiliating
scene might be prolonged: and she must be rid
of the creature at any cost. After all, she seldom wore
the sapphire&mdash;months might pass without its absence
being noted by Amherst's careless eye; and if Wyant
should pawn it, she might somehow save money to buy
it back before it was missed. She went through these
calculations with feverish rapidity; then she turned
again to Wyant.</p>

<p>"You won't come back&mdash;ever?"</p>

<p>"I swear I won't," he said.</p>

<p>He moved away toward the window, as if to spare
her; and she turned and slowly left the room.</p>

<p>She never forgot the moments that followed. Once
outside the door she was in such haste that she stumbled
on the stairs, and had to pause on the landing to
regain her breath. In her room she found one of the
housemaids busy, and at first could think of no pretext
for dismissing her. Then she bade the woman go
down and send the brougham away, telling the coachman
to call for Miss Cicely at six.</p>

<p>Left alone, she bolted the door, and as if with a
thief's hand, opened her wardrobe, unlocked her jewel-box,
and drew out the sapphire in its flat morocco case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[p 508]</a></span>
She restored the box to its place, the key to its ring&mdash;then
she opened the case and looked at the sapphire.
As she did so, a little tremor ran over her neck and
throat, and closing her eyes she felt her husband's kiss,
and the touch of his hands as he fastened on the jewel.</p>

<p>She unbolted the door, listened intently on the landing,
and then went slowly down the stairs. None of
the servants were in sight, yet as she reached the lower
hall she was conscious that the air had grown suddenly
colder, as though the outer door had just been opened.
She paused, and listened again. There was a sound
of talking in the drawing-room. Could it be that in
her absence a visitor had been admitted? The possibility
frightened her at first&mdash;then she welcomed it as
an unexpected means of ridding herself of her tormentor.</p>

<p>She opened the drawing-room door, and saw her
husband talking with Wyant.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXXV" id="XXXV"></a>XXXV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amherst</span>, his back to the threshold, sat at a
table writing: Wyant stood a few feet away,
staring down at the fire.</p>

<p>Neither had heard the door open; and before they
were aware of her entrance Justine had calculated that
she must have been away for at least five minutes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[p 509]</a></span>
that in that space of time almost anything might have
passed between them.</p>

<p>For a moment the power of connected thought left
her; then her heart gave a bound of relief. She said to
herself that Wyant had doubtless made some allusion
to his situation, and that her husband, conscious only
of a great debt of gratitude, had at once sat down to
draw a cheque for him. The idea was so reassuring
that it restored all her clearness of thought.</p>

<p>Wyant was the first to see her. He made an abrupt
movement, and Amherst, rising, turned and put an
envelope in his hand.</p>

<p>"There, my dear fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he turned he caught sight of his wife.</p>

<p>"I caught the twelve o'clock train after all&mdash;you got
my second wire?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she faltered, pressing her left hand, with the
little case in it, close to the folds of her dress.</p>

<p>"I was afraid not. There was a bad storm at Hanaford,
and they said there might be a delay."</p>

<p>At the same moment she found Wyant advancing
with extended hand, and understood that he had concealed
the fact of having already seen her. She accepted
the cue, and shook his hand, murmuring:
"How do you do?"</p>

<p>Amherst looked at her, perhaps struck by her manner.</p>

<p>"You have not seen Dr. Wyant since Lynbrook?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[p 510]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she answered, thankful to have this pretext
for her emotion.</p>

<p>"I have been telling him that he should not have left
us so long without news&mdash;especially as he has been ill,
and things have gone rather badly with him. But I
hope we can help now. He has heard that Saint Christopher's
is looking for a house-physician for the paying
patients' wing, and as Mr. Langhope is away I have
given him a line to Mrs. Ansell."</p>

<p>"Extremely kind of you," Wyant murmured, passing
his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>Justine stood silent. She wondered that her husband
had not noticed that tremulous degraded hand.
But he was always so blind to externals&mdash;and he had
no medical experience to sharpen his perceptions.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt impelled to speak "I am sorry
Dr. Wyant has been&mdash;unfortunate. Of course you
will want to do everything to help him; but would it not
be better to wait till Mr. Langhope comes back?"</p>

<p>"Wyant thinks the delay might make him lose the
place. It seems the board meets tomorrow. And Mrs.
Ansell really knows much more about it. Isn't she the
secretary of the ladies' committee?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure&mdash;I believe so. But surely Mr. Langhope
should be consulted."</p>

<p>She felt Wyant's face change: his eyes settled on her
in a threatening stare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[p 511]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst looked at her also, and there was surprise
in his glance. "I think I can answer for my father-in-law.
He feels as strongly as I do how much we all
owe to Dr. Wyant."</p>

<p>He seldom spoke of Mr. Langhope as his father-in-law,
and the chance designation seemed to mark a
closer tie between them, to exclude Justine from what
was after all a family affair. For a moment she felt
tempted to accept the suggestion, and let the responsibility
fall where it would. But it would fall on Amherst&mdash;and
that was intolerable.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to wait," she insisted.</p>

<p>An embarrassed silence settled on the three.</p>

<p>Wyant broke it by advancing toward Amherst. "I
shall never forget your kindness," he said; "and I hope
to prove to Mrs. Amherst that it's not misplaced."</p>

<p>The words were well chosen, and well spoken;
Justine saw that they produced a good effect. Amherst
grasped the physician's hand with a smile. "My dear
fellow, I wish I could do more. Be sure to call on me
again if you want help."</p>

<p>"Oh, you've put me on my feet," said Wyant gratefully.</p>

<p>He bowed slightly to Justine and turned to go; but
as he reached the threshold she moved after him.</p>

<p>"Dr. Wyant&mdash;you must give back that letter."</p>

<p>He stopped short with a whitening face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[p 512]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt Amherst's eyes on her again; and she said
desperately, addressing him: "Dr. Wyant understands
my reasons."</p>

<p>Her husband's glance turned abruptly to Wyant.
"Do you?" he asked after a pause.</p>

<p>Wyant looked from one to the other. The moisture
came out on his forehead, and he passed his hand over
it again. "Yes," he said in a dry voice. "Mrs. Amherst
wants me farther off&mdash;out of New York."</p>

<p>"Out of New York? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Justine interposed hastily, before the answer could
come. "It is because Dr. Wyant is not in condition&mdash;for
such a place&mdash;just at present."</p>

<p>"But he assures me he is quite well."</p>

<p>There was another silence; and again Wyant broke
in, this time with a slight laugh. "I can explain what
Mrs. Amherst means; she intends to accuse me of the
morphine habit. And I can explain her reason for
doing so&mdash;she wants me out of the way."</p>

<p>Amherst turned on the speaker; and, as she had foreseen,
his look was terrible. "You haven't explained
that yet," he said.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I can." Wyant waited another moment.
"I know too much about her," he declared.</p>

<p>There was a low exclamation from Justine, and Amherst
strode toward Wyant. "You infernal blackguard!"
he cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[p 513]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, gently&mdash;&mdash;" Wyant muttered, flinching back
from his outstretched arm.</p>

<p>"My wife's wish is sufficient. Give me back that
letter."</p>

<p>Wyant straightened himself. "No, by God, I won't!"
he retorted furiously. "I didn't ask you for it till you
offered to help me; but I won't let it be taken back
without a word, like a thief that you'd caught with your
umbrella. If your wife won't explain I will. She's,
afraid I'll talk about what happened at Lynbrook."</p>

<p>Amherst's arm fell to his side. "At Lynbrook?"</p>

<p>Behind him there was a sound of inarticulate appeal&mdash;but
he took no notice.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's she who used morphia&mdash;but not on herself.
She gives it to other people. She gave an overdose
to Mrs. Amherst."</p>

<p>Amherst looked at him confusedly. "An overdose?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;purposely, I mean. And I came into the
room at the wrong time. I can prove that Mrs. Amherst
died of morphia-poisoning."</p>

<p>"John!" Justine gasped out, pressing between them.</p>

<p>Amherst gently put aside the hand with which she
had caught his arm. "Wait a moment: this can't rest
here. You can't want it to," he said to her in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Why do you care...for what he says...when I
don't?" she breathed back with trembling lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[p 514]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can see I am not wanted here," Wyant threw
in with a sneer.</p>

<p>Amherst remained silent for a brief space; then he
turned his eyes once more to his wife.</p>

<p>Justine lifted her face: it looked small and spent,
like an extinguished taper.</p>

<p>"It's true," she said.</p>

<p>"True?"</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> give...an overdose...intentionally, when
I knew there was no hope, and when the surgeons said
she might go on suffering. She was very strong...and
I couldn't bear it...you couldn't have borne
it...."</p>

<p>There was another silence; then she went on in a
stronger voice, looking straight at her husband: "And
now will you send this man away?"</p>

<p>Amherst glanced at Wyant without moving. "Go,"
he said curtly.</p>

<p>Wyant, instead, moved a step nearer. "Just a
minute, please. It's only fair to hear my side. Your
wife says there was no hope; yet the day before she...gave
the dose, Dr. Garford told her in my presence that
Mrs. Amherst might live."</p>

<p>Again Amherst's eyes addressed themselves slowly
to Justine; and she forced her lips to articulate an
answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[p 515]</a></span></p><p>"Dr. Garford said...one could never tell...but
I know he didn't believe in the chance of recovery...no
one did."</p>

<p>"Dr. Garford is dead," said Wyant grimly.</p>

<p>Amherst strode up to him again. "You scoundrel&mdash;leave
the house!" he commanded.</p>

<p>But still Wyant sneeringly stood his ground. "Not
till I've finished. I can't afford to let myself be kicked
out like a dog because I happen to be in the way.
Every doctor knows that in cases of spinal lesion recovery
is becoming more and more frequent&mdash;if the
patient survives the third week there's every reason to
hope. Those are the facts as they would appear to
any surgeon. If they're not true, why is Mrs. Amherst
afraid of having them stated? Why has she been paying
me for nearly a year to keep them quiet?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;" Justine moaned.</p>

<p>"I never thought of talking till luck went against
me. Then I asked her for help&mdash;and reminded her of
certain things. After that she kept me supplied pretty
regularly." He thrust his shaking hand into an inner
pocket. "Here are her envelopes...Quebec...Montreal...Saranac...I
know just where you went
on your honeymoon. She had to write often, because
the sums were small. Why did she do it, if she wasn't
afraid? And why did she go upstairs just now to fetch
me something? If you don't believe me, ask her what
she's got in her hand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[p 516]</a></span></p>

<p>Amherst did not heed this injunction. He stood
motionless, gripping the back of a chair, as if his next
gesture might be to lift and hurl it at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Ask her&mdash;&mdash;" Wyant repeated.</p>

<p>Amherst turned his head slowly, and his dull gaze
rested on his wife. His face looked years older&mdash;lips
and eyes moved as heavily as an old man's.</p>

<p>As he looked at her, Justine came forward without
speaking, and laid the little morocco case in his hand.
He held it there a moment, as if hardly understanding
her action&mdash;then he tossed it on the table at his elbow,
and walked up to Wyant.</p>

<p>"You hound," he said&mdash;"now go!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXXVI" id="XXXVI"></a>XXXVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Wyant had left the room, and the house-door
had closed on him, Amherst spoke to his
wife.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs," he said.</p>

<p>Justine followed him, scarcely conscious where she
went, but moving already with a lighter tread. Part
of her weight of misery had been lifted with Wyant's
going. She had suffered less from the fear of what her
husband might think than from the shame of making
her avowal in her defamer's presence. And her faith
in Amherst's comprehension had begun to revive. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[p 517]</a></span>
had dismissed Wyant with scorn and horror&mdash;did not
that show that he was on her side already? And how
many more arguments she had at her call! Her
brain hummed with them as she followed him up the
stairs.</p>

<p>In her bedroom he closed the door and stood motionless,
the same heavy half-paralyzed look on his face.
It frightened her and she went up to him.</p>

<p>"John!" she said timidly.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head. "Wait a moment&mdash;&mdash;"
he returned; and she waited, her heart slowly sinking
again.</p>

<p>The moment over, he seemed to recover his power of
movement. He crossed the room and threw himself
into the armchair near the hearth.</p>

<p>"Now tell me everything."</p>

<p>He sat thrown back, his eyes fixed on the fire, and
the vertical lines between his brows forming a deep
scar in his white face.</p>

<p>Justine moved nearer, and touched his arm beseechingly.
"Won't you look at me?"</p>

<p>He turned his head slowly, as if with an effort, and
his eyes rested reluctantly on hers.</p>

<p>"Oh, not like that!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He seemed to make a stronger effort at self-control.
"Please don't heed me&mdash;but say what there is to say,"
he said in a level voice, his gaze on the fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[p 518]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood before him, her arms hanging down, her
clasped fingers twisting restlessly.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there is much to say&mdash;beyond
what I've told you."</p>

<p>There was a slight sound in Amherst's throat, like
the ghost of a derisive laugh. After another interval
he said: "I wish to hear exactly what happened."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the edge of a chair near by,
bending forward, with hands interlocked and arms extended
on her knees&mdash;every line reaching out to him,
as though her whole slight body were an arrow winged
with pleadings. It was a relief to speak at last, even
face to face with the stony image that sat in her husband's
place; and she told her story, detail by detail,
omitting nothing, exaggerating nothing, speaking slowly,
clearly, with precision, aware that the bare facts were
her strongest argument.</p>

<p>Amherst, as he listened, shifted his position once,
raising his hand so that it screened his face; and in that
attitude he remained when she had ended.</p>

<p>As she waited for him to speak, Justine realized that
her heart had been alive with tremulous hopes. All
through her narrative she had counted on a murmur of
perception, an exclamation of pity: she had felt sure of
melting the stony image. But Amherst said no word.</p>

<p>At length he spoke, still without turning his head.
"You have not told me why you kept this from me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[p 519]</a></span></p>

<p>A sob formed in her throat, and she had to wait to
steady her voice.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that was my wrong&mdash;my weakness. When I
did it I never thought of being afraid to tell you&mdash;I had
talked it over with you in my own mind...so often...before...."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;- when you came back it was harder...though
I was still sure you would approve me."</p>

<p>"Why harder?"</p>

<p>"Because at first&mdash;at Lynbrook&mdash;I <i>could not</i> tell it
all over, in detail, as I have now...it was beyond
human power...and without doing so, I couldn't
make it all clear to you...and so should only have
added to your pain. If you had been there you would
have done as I did.... I felt sure of that from the first.
But coming afterward, you couldn't judge...no one
who was not there could judge...and I wanted to
spare you...."</p>

<p>"And afterward?"</p>

<p>She had shrunk in advance from this question, and
she could not answer it at once. To gain time she
echoed it. "Afterward?"</p>

<p>"Did it never occur to you, when we met later&mdash;when
you first went to Mr. Langhope&mdash;&mdash;"?</p>

<p>"To tell you then? No&mdash;because by that time I had
come to see that I could never be quite sure of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[p 520]</a></span>
you understand. No one who was not there at the
time could know what it was to see her suffer."</p>

<p>"You thought it all over, then&mdash;decided definitely
against telling me?"</p>

<p>"I did not have to think long. I felt I had done right&mdash;I
still feel so&mdash;and I was sure you would feel so, if you
were in the same circumstances."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Then Amherst said:
"And last September&mdash;at Hanaford?"</p>

<p>It was the word for which she had waited&mdash;the word
of her inmost fears. She felt the blood mount to her
face.</p>

<p>"Did you see no difference&mdash;no special reason for
telling me then?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Yet you said nothing."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Silence again. Her eyes strayed to the clock, and
some dim association of ideas told her that Cicely would
soon be coming in.</p>

<p>"Why did you say nothing?"</p>

<p>He lowered his hand and turned toward her as he
spoke; and she looked up and faced him.</p>

<p>"Because I regarded the question as settled. I had
decided it in my own mind months before, and had
never regretted my decision. I should have thought it
morbid...unnatural...to go over the whole subject
again...to let it affect a situation that had come about...so
much later...so unexpectedly."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[p 521]</a></span>
</p>

<p>"Did you never feel that, later, if I came to know&mdash;if
others came to know&mdash;it might be difficult&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No; for I didn't care for the others&mdash;and I believed
that, whatever your own feelings were, you would know
I had done what I thought right."</p>

<p>She spoke the words proudly, strongly, and for the
first time the hard lines of his face relaxed, and a slight
tremor crossed it.</p>

<p>"If you believed this, why have you been letting that
cur blackmail you?"</p>

<p>"Because when he began I saw for the first time that
what I had done might be turned against me by&mdash;by
those who disliked our marriage. And I was afraid
for my happiness. That was my weakness...it is
what I am suffering for now."</p>

<p>"<i>Suffering</i>!" he echoed ironically, as though she had
presumed to apply to herself a word of which he had
the grim monopoly. He rose and took a few aimless
steps; then he halted before her.</p>

<p>"That day&mdash;last month&mdash;when you asked me for
money...was it...?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;" she said, her head sinking.</p>

<p>He laughed. "You couldn't tell me&mdash;but you could
use my money to bribe that fellow to conspire with
you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[p 522]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had none of my own."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nor I either! You used <i>her</i> money.&mdash;God!"
he groaned, turning away with clenched hands.</p>

<p>Justine had risen also, and she stood motionless,
her hands clasped against her breast, in the drawn
shrinking attitude of a fugitive overtaken by a blinding
storm. He moved back to her with an appealing gesture.</p>

<p>"And you didn't see&mdash;it didn't occur to you&mdash;that
your doing...as you did...was an obstacle&mdash;an insurmountable
obstacle&mdash;to our ever ...?"</p>

<p>She cut him short with an indignant cry. "No!
No! for it was <i>not</i>. How could it have anything to do
with what...came after...with you or me? I did
it only for Bessy&mdash;it concerned only Bessy!"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't name her!" broke from him harshly, and
she drew back, cut to the heart.</p>

<p>There was another pause, during which he seemed
to fall into a kind of dazed irresolution, his head on
his breast, as though unconscious of her presence.
Then he roused himself and went to the door.</p>

<p>As he passed her she sprang after him. "John&mdash;John!
Is that all you have to say?"</p>

<p>"What more is there?"</p>

<p>"What more? Everything!&mdash;What right have you
to turn from me as if I were a murderess? I did nothing
but what your own reason, your own arguments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[p 523]</a></span>
have justified a hundred times! I made a mistake in
not telling you at once&mdash;but a mistake is not a crime.
It can't be your real feeling that turns you from me&mdash;it
must be the dread of what other people would think!
But when have you cared for what other people thought?
When have your own actions been governed by it?"</p>

<p>He moved another step without speaking, and she
caught him by the arm. "No! you sha'n't go&mdash;not
like that!&mdash;Wait!"</p>

<p>She turned and crossed the room. On the lower
shelf of the little table by her bed a few books were
ranged: she stooped and drew one hurriedly forth, opening
it at the fly-leaf as she went back to Amherst.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;read that. The book was at Lynbrook&mdash;in
your room&mdash;and I came across it by chance the very
day...."</p>

<p>It was the little volume of Bacon which she was
thrusting at him. He took it with a bewildered look,
as if scarcely following what she said.</p>

<p>"Read it&mdash;read it!" she commanded; and mechanically
he read out the words he had written.</p>

<p>"<i>La vraie morale se moque de la morale.... We perish
because we follow other men's examples.... Socrates
called the opinions of the many Lami&aelig;.</i>&mdash;Good God!"
he exclaimed, flinging the book from him with a gesture
of abhorrence.</p>

<p>Justine watched him with panting lips, her knees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[p 524]</a></span>
trembling under her. "But you wrote it&mdash;you wrote
it! I thought you meant it!" she cried, as the book
spun across a table and dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>He looked at her coldly, almost apprehensively, as
if she had grown suddenly dangerous and remote; then
he turned and walked out of the room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The striking of the clock roused her. She rose to her
feet, rang the bell, and told the maid, through the door,
that she had a headache, and was unable to see Miss
Cicely. Then she turned back into the room, and
darkness closed on her. She was not the kind to take
grief passively&mdash;it drove her in anguished pacings up
and down the floor. She walked and walked till her
legs flagged under her; then she dropped stupidly into
the chair where Amherst had sat....</p>

<p>All her world had crumbled about her. It was as if
some law of mental gravity had been mysteriously suspended,
and every firmly-anchored conviction, every
accepted process of reasoning, spun disconnectedly
through space. Amherst had not understood her&mdash;worse
still, he had judged her as the world might judge
her! The core of her misery was there. With terrible
clearness she saw the suspicion that had crossed his
mind&mdash;the suspicion that she had kept silence in the
beginning because she loved him, and feared to lose
him if she spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[p 525]</a></span></p>

<p>And what if it were true? What if her unconscious
guilt went back even farther than his thought dared to
track it? She could not now recall a time when she
had not loved him. Every chance meeting with him,
from their first brief talk at Hanaford, stood out embossed
and glowing against the blur of lesser memories.
Was it possible that she had loved him during
Bessy's life&mdash;that she had even, sub-consciously, blindly,
been urged by her feeling for him to perform the act?</p>

<p>But she shook herself free from this morbid horror&mdash;the
rebound of health was always prompt in her, and
her mind instinctively rejected every form of moral
poison. No! Her motive had been normal, sane and
justifiable&mdash;completely justifiable. Her fault lay in
having dared to rise above conventional restrictions,
her mistake in believing that her husband could rise
with her. These reflections steadied her but they did
not bring much comfort. For her whole life was centred
in Amherst, and she saw that he would never be
able to free himself from the traditional view of her act.
In looking back, and correcting her survey of his character
in the revealing light of the last hours, she perceived
that, like many men of emancipated thought,
he had remained subject to the old conventions of feeling.
And he had probably never given much thought
to women till he met her&mdash;had always been content to
deal with them in the accepted currency of sentiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[p 526]</a></span>
After all, it was the currency they liked best, and for
which they offered their prettiest wares!</p>

<p>But what of the intellectual accord between himself
and her? She had not been deceived in that! He
and she had really been wedded in mind as well as in
heart. But until now there had not arisen in their
lives one of those searching questions which call into
play emotions rooted far below reason and judgment, in
the dark primal depths of inherited feeling. It is easy
to judge impersonal problems intellectually, turning
on them the full light of acquired knowledge; but too
often one must still grope one's way through the personal
difficulty by the dim taper carried in long-dead
hands....</p>

<p>But was there then no hope of lifting one's individual
life to a clearer height of conduct? Must one be content
to think for the race, and to feel only&mdash;feel blindly
and incoherently&mdash;for one's self? And was it not from
such natures as Amherst's&mdash;natures in which independence
of judgment was blent with strong human sympathy&mdash;that
the liberating impulse should come?</p>

<p>Her mind grew weary of revolving in this vain circle
of questions. The fact was that, in their particular
case, Amherst had not risen above prejudice and emotion;
that, though her act was one to which his intellectual
sanction was given, he had turned from her with
instinctive repugnance, had dishonoured her by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[p 527]</a></span>
most wounding suspicions. The tie between them was
forever stained and debased.</p>

<p>Justine's long hospital-discipline made it impossible
for her to lose consciousness of the lapse of time, or to
let her misery thicken into mental stupor. She could
not help thinking and moving; and she presently lifted
herself to her feet, turned on the light, and began to
prepare for dinner. It would be terrible to face her
husband across Mr. Langhope's pretty dinner-table,
and afterward in the charming drawing-room, with its
delicate old ornaments and intimate luxurious furniture;
but she could not continue to sit motionless in the dark:
it was her innermost instinct to pick herself up and go
on.</p>

<p>While she dressed she listened anxiously for Amherst's
step in the next room; but there was no sound,
and when she dragged herself downstairs the drawing-room
was empty, and the parlour-maid, after a decent
delay, came to ask if dinner should be postponed.</p>

<p>She said no, murmuring some vague pretext for her
husband's absence, and sitting alone through the succession
of courses which composed the brief but carefully-studied
<i>menu</i>. When this ordeal was over she
returned to the drawing-room and took up a book.
It chanced to be a new volume on labour problems,
which Amherst must have brought back with him from
Westmore; and it carried her thoughts instantly to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[p 528]</a></span>
mills. Would this disaster poison their work there
as well as their personal relation? Would he think
of her as carrying contamination even into the task their
love had illumined?</p>

<p>The hours went on without his returning, and at
length it occurred to her that he might have taken the
night train to Hanaford. Her heart contracted at the
thought: she remembered&mdash;though every nerve shrank
from the analogy&mdash;his sudden flight at another crisis
in his life, and she felt obscurely that if he escaped from
her now she would never recover her hold on him. But
could he be so cruel&mdash;could he wish any one to suffer
as she was suffering?</p>

<p>At ten o'clock she could endure the drawing-room
no longer, and went up to her room again. She undressed
slowly, trying to prolong the process as much as
possible, to put off the period of silence and inaction
which would close in on her when she lay down on her
bed. But at length the dreaded moment came&mdash;there
was nothing more between her and the night. She
crept into bed and put out the light; but as she slipped
between the cold sheets a trembling seized her, and after
a moment she drew on her dressing-gown again and
groped her way to the lounge by the fire.</p>

<p>She pushed the lounge closer to the hearth and lay
down, still shivering, though she had drawn the quilted
coverlet up to her chin. She lay there a long time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[p 529]</a></span>
with closed eyes, in a mental darkness torn by sudden
flashes of memory. In one of these flashes a phrase of
Amherst's stood out&mdash;a word spoken at Westmore, on
the day of the opening of the Emergency Hospital, about
a good-looking young man who had called to see her.
She remembered Amherst's boyish burst of jealousy,
his sudden relief at the thought that the visitor might
have been Wyant. And no doubt it <i>was</i> Wyant&mdash;Wyant
who had come to Hanaford to threaten her, and
who, baffled by her non-arrival, or for some other unexplained
reason, had left again without carrying out
his purpose.</p>

<p>It was dreadful to think by how slight a chance her
first draught of happiness had escaped that drop of
poison; yet, when she understood, her inward cry was:
"If it had happened, my dearest need not have suffered!"...
Already she was feeling Amherst's pain
more than her own, understanding that it was harder
to bear than hers because it was at war with all the
reflective part of his nature.</p>

<p>As she lay there, her face pressed into the cushions,
she heard a sound through the silent house&mdash;the opening
and closing of the outer door. She turned cold,
and lay listening with strained ears.... Yes; now there
was a step on the stairs&mdash;her husband's step! She
heard him turn into his own room. The throbs of her
heart almost deafened her&mdash;she only distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[p 530]</a></span>
confusedly that he was moving about within, so close
that it was as if she felt his touch. Then her door
opened and he entered.</p>

<p>He stumbled slightly in the darkness before he found
the switch of the lamp; and as he bent over it she saw
that his face was flushed, and that his eyes had an excited
light which, in any one less abstemious, might
almost have seemed like the effect of wine.</p>

<p>"Are you awake?" he asked.</p>

<p>She started up against the cushions, her black hair
streaming about her small ghostly face.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He walked over to the lounge and dropped into the
low chair beside it.</p>

<p>"I've given that cur a lesson he won't forget," he
exclaimed, breathing hard, the redness deepening in his
face.</p>

<p>She turned on him in joy and trembling. "John!&mdash;Oh,
John! You didn't follow him? Oh, what happened?
What have you done?"</p>

<p>"No. I didn't follow him. But there are some
things that even the powers above can't stand. And so
they managed to let me run across him&mdash;by the merest
accident&mdash;and I gave him something to remember."</p>

<p>He spoke in a strong clear voice that had a brightness
like the brightness in his eyes. She felt its heat
in her veins&mdash;the primitive woman in her glowed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[p 531]</a></span>
contact with the primitive man. But reflection chilled
her the next moment.</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;why? Oh, how could you? Where
did it happen&mdash;oh, not in the street?"</p>

<p>As she questioned him, there rose before her the
terrified vision of a crowd gathering&mdash;the police, newspapers,
a hideous publicity. He must have been mad
to do it&mdash;and yet he must have done it because he loved
her!</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. Don't be afraid. The powers looked
after that too. There was no one about&mdash;and I don't
think he'll talk much about it."</p>

<p>She trembled, fearing yet adoring him. Nothing
could have been more unlike the Amherst she fancied
she knew than this act of irrational anger which had
magically lifted the darkness from his spirit; yet, magically
also, it gave him back to her, made them one flesh
once more. And suddenly the pressure of opposed
emotions became too strong, and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>She wept painfully, violently, with the resistance of
strong natures unused to emotional expression; till at
length, through the tumult of her tears, she felt her
husband's reassuring touch.</p>

<p>"Justine," he said, speaking once more in his natural
voice.</p>

<p>She raised her face from her hands, and they looked
at each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[p 532]</a></span></p>

<p>"Justine&mdash;this afternoon&mdash;I said things I didn't
mean to say."</p>

<p>Her lips parted, but her throat was still full of sobs,
and she could only look at him while the tears ran down.</p>

<p>"I believe I understand now," he continued, in the
same quiet tone.</p>

<p>Her hand shrank from his clasp, and she began to
tremble again. "Oh, if you only <i>believe</i>...if you're
not sure...don't pretend to be!"</p>

<p>He sat down beside her and drew her into his arms.
"I am sure," he whispered, holding her close, and
pressing his lips against her face and hair.</p>

<p>"Oh, my husband&mdash;my husband! You've come
back to me?"</p>

<p>He answered her with more kisses, murmuring
through them: "Poor child&mdash;poor child&mdash;poor Justine...."
while he held her fast.</p>

<p>With her face against him she yielded to the childish
luxury of murmuring out unjustified fears. "I was
afraid you had gone back to Hanaford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tonight? To Hanaford?"</p>

<p>"To tell your mother."</p>

<p>She felt a contraction of the arm embracing her, as
though a throb of pain had stiffened it.</p>

<p>"I shall never tell any one," he said abruptly; but
as he felt in her a responsive shrinking he gathered
her close again, whispering through the hair that fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[p 533]</a></span>
about her cheek: "Don't talk, dear...let us never
talk of it again...." And in the clasp of his arms her
terror and anguish subsided, giving way, not to the deep
peace of tranquillized thought, but to a confused well-being
that lulled all thought to sleep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXXVII" id="XXXVII"></a>XXXVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> thought could never be long silent between
them; and Justine's triumph lasted but a day.</p>

<p>With its end she saw what it had been made of: the
ascendency of youth and sex over his subjugated judgment.
Her first impulse was to try and maintain it&mdash;why
not use the protective arts with which love inspired
her? She who lived so keenly in the brain could live
as intensely in her feelings; her quick imagination
tutored her looks and words, taught her the spells to
weave about shorn giants. And for a few days she and
Amherst lost themselves in this self-evoked cloud of
passion, both clinging fast to the visible, the palpable
in their relation, as if conscious already that its finer
essence had fled.</p>

<p>Amherst made no allusion to what had passed, asked
for no details, offered no reassurances&mdash;behaved as if
the whole episode had been effaced from his mind.
And from Wyant there came no sound: he seemed to
have disappeared from life as he had from their talk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[p 534]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the end of the week Amherst announced
that he must return to Hanaford; and Justine at once
declared her intention of going with him.</p>

<p>He seemed surprised, disconcerted almost; and for
the first time the shadow of what had happened fell
visibly between them.</p>

<p>"But ought you to leave Cicely before Mr. Langhope
comes back?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"He will be here in two days."</p>

<p>"But he will expect to find you."</p>

<p>"It is almost the first of April. We are to have
Cicely with us for the summer. There is no reason
why I should not go back to my work at Westmore."</p>

<p>There was in fact no reason that he could produce;
and the next day they returned to Hanaford together.</p>

<p>With her perceptions strung to the last pitch of sensitiveness,
she felt a change in Amherst as soon as they
re-entered Bessy's house. He was still scrupulously
considerate, almost too scrupulously tender; but with
a tinge of lassitude, like a man who tries to keep up
under the stupefying approach of illness. And she began
to hate the power by which she held him. It was
not thus they had once walked together, free in mind
though so linked in habit and feeling; when their love
was not a deadening drug but a vivifying element that
cleared thought instead of stifling it. There were
moments when she felt that open alienation would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[p 535]</a></span>
easier, because it would be nearer the truth. And at
such moments she longed to speak, to beg him to utter
his mind, to go with her once for all into the depths of
the subject they continued to avoid. But at the last
her heart always failed her: she could not face the
thought of losing him, of hearing him speak estranging
words to her.</p>

<p>They had been at Hanaford for about ten days when,
one morning at breakfast, Amherst uttered a sudden
exclamation over a letter he was reading.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked in a tremor.</p>

<p>He had grown very pale, and was pushing the hair
from his forehead with the gesture habitual to him in
moments of painful indecision.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Justine repeated, her fear growing.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;&mdash;" he began, thrusting the letter under
the pile of envelopes by his plate; but she continued to
look at him anxiously, till she drew his eyes to hers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langhope writes that they've appointed Wyant
to Saint Christopher's," he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, the letter&mdash;we forgot the letter!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we forgot the letter."</p>

<p>"But how dare he&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Amherst said nothing, but the long silence between
them seemed full of ironic answers, till she brought
out, hardly above her breath: "What shall you
do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[p 536]</a></span></p>

<p>"Write at once&mdash;tell Mr. Langhope he's not fit for
the place."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

<p>He went on tearing open his other letters, and glancing
at their contents. She leaned back in her chair,
her cup of coffee untasted, listening to the recurrent
crackle of torn paper as he tossed aside one letter after
another.</p>

<p>Presently he rose from his seat, and as she followed
him from the dining-room she noticed that his breakfast
had also remained untasted. He gathered up his
letters and walked toward the smoking-room; and after
a moment's hesitation she joined him.</p>

<p>"John," she said from the threshold.</p>

<p>He was just seating himself at his desk, but he turned
to her with an obvious effort at kindness which made the
set look of his face the more marked.</p>

<p>She closed the door and went up to him.</p>

<p>"If you write that to Mr. Langhope&mdash;Dr. Wyant
will&mdash;will tell him," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we must be prepared for that."</p>

<p>She was silent, and Amherst flung himself down on
the leather ottoman against the wall. She stood before
him, clasping and unclasping her hands in speechless
distress.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" he asked at length,
almost irritably.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[p 537]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only thought...he told me he would keep
straight...if he only had a chance," she faltered
out.</p>

<p>Amherst lifted his head slowly, and looked at her.
"You mean&mdash;I am to do nothing? Is that it?"</p>

<p>She moved nearer to him with beseeching eyes. "I
can't bear it.... I can't bear that others should come
between us," she broke out passionately.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but she could see a look of suffering
cross his face, and coming still closer, she sank
down on the ottoman, laying her hand on his. "John...oh,
John, spare me," she whispered.</p>

<p>For a moment his hand lay quiet under hers; then
he drew it out, and enclosed her trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;I'll give him a chance&mdash;I'll do nothing,"
he said, suddenly putting his other arm about her.</p>

<p>The reaction caught her by the throat, forcing out a
dry sob or two; and as she pressed her face against him
he raised it up and gently kissed her.</p>

<p>But even as their lips met she felt that they were sealing
a treaty with dishonour. That his kiss should come
to mean that to her! It was unbearable&mdash;worse than
any personal pain&mdash;the thought of dragging him down
to falsehood through her weakness.</p>

<p>She drew back and rose to her feet, putting aside his
detaining hand.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! What am I saying? It can't be&mdash;you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[p 538]</a></span>
must tell the truth." Her voice gathered strength as
she spoke. "Oh, forget what I said&mdash;I didn't mean
it!"</p>

<p>But again he seemed sunk in inaction, like a man
over whom some baneful lethargy is stealing.</p>

<p>"John&mdash;John&mdash;forget!" she repeated urgently.</p>

<p>He looked up at her. "You realize what it will
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I realize.... But it must be.... And it will
make no difference between us...will it?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. Why should it?" he answered apathetically.</p>

<p>"Then write&mdash;tell Mr. Langhope not to give him the
place. I want it over."</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet, without looking at her
again, and walked over to the desk. She sank down
on the ottoman and watched him with burning eyes
while he drew forth a sheet of note-paper and began
to write.</p>

<p>But after he had written a few words he laid down
his pen, and swung his chair about so that he faced her.</p>

<p>"I can't do it in this way," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"How then? What do you mean?" she said, starting
up.</p>

<p>He looked at her. "Do you want the story to come
from Wyant?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;" She looked back at him with sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[p 539]</a></span>
insight. "You mean to tell Mr. Langhope yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I mean to take the next train to town and
tell him."</p>

<p>Her trembling increased so much that she had to
rest her hands against the edge of the ottoman to steady
herself. "But if...if after all...Wyant should not
speak?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if he shouldn't? Could you bear to owe
our safety to <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"Safety!"</p>

<p>"It comes to that, doesn't it, if <i>we're</i> afraid to speak?"</p>

<p>She sat silent, letting the bitter truth of this sink
into her till it poured courage into her veins.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it comes to that," she confessed.</p>

<p>"Then you feel as I do?"</p>

<p>"That you must go&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That this is intolerable!"</p>

<p>The words struck down her last illusion, and she rose
and went over to the writing-table. "Yes&mdash;go," she
said.</p>

<p>He stood up also, and took both her hands, not in a
caress, but gravely, almost severely.</p>

<p>"Listen, Justine. You must understand exactly
what this means&mdash;may mean. I am willing to go on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[p 540]</a></span>as we are now...as long as we can...because I
love you...because I would do anything to spare
you pain. But if I speak I must say everything&mdash;I
must follow this thing up to its uttermost consequences.
That's what I want to make clear to you."</p>

<p>Her heart sank with a foreboding of new peril.
"What consequences?"</p>

<p>"Can't you see for yourself&mdash;when you look about
this house?"</p>

<p>"This house&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He dropped her hands and took an abrupt turn across
the room.</p>

<p>"I owe everything to her," he broke out, "all I am,
all I have, all I have been able to give you&mdash;and I must
go and tell her father that you...."</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;stop!" she cried, lifting her hands as if to
keep off a blow.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't make me stop. We must face it," he
said doggedly.</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this isn't the truth! You put it as if&mdash;almost
as if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;don't finish.&mdash;Has it occurred to you that <i>he</i>
may think that?" Amherst asked with a terrible laugh.
But at that she recovered her courage, as she always
did when an extreme call was made on it.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't believe it! If he <i>does</i>, it will be because
you think it yourself...." Her voice sank, and
she lifted her hands and pressed them to her temples.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[p 541]</a></span>"And if you think it, nothing matters...one way or
the other...." She paused, and her voice regained its
strength. "That is what I must face before you go:
what <i>you</i> think, what <i>you</i> believe of me. You've never
told me that."</p>

<p>Amherst, at the challenge, remained silent, while a
slow red crept to his cheek-bones.</p>

<p>"Haven't I told you by&mdash;by what I've done?" he
said slowly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what you've done has covered up what you
thought; and I've helped you cover it&mdash;I'm to blame
too! But it was not for this that we...that we had
that half-year together...not to sink into connivance
and evasion! I don't want another hour of sham happiness.
I want the truth from you, whatever it is."</p>

<p>He stood motionless, staring moodily at the floor.
"Don't you see that's my misery&mdash;that I don't know
myself?"</p>

<p>"You don't know...what you think of me?"</p>

<p>"Good God, Justine, why do you try to strip life
naked? I don't know what's been going on in me these
last weeks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must know what you think of my motive...for
doing what I did."</p>

<p>She saw in his face how he shrank from the least allusion
to the act about which their torment revolved.
But he forced himself to raise his head and look at her.
"I have never&mdash;for one moment&mdash;questioned your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[p 542]</a></span>
motive&mdash;or failed to see that it was justified...under
the circumstances...."</p>

<p>"Oh, John&mdash;John!" she broke out in the wild joy
of hearing herself absolved; but the next instant her
subtle perceptions felt the unconscious reserve behind
his admission.</p>

<p>"Your mind justifies me&mdash;not your heart; isn't <i>that</i>
your misery?" she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her almost piteously, as if, in the last
resort, it was from her that light must come to him.
"On my soul, I don't know...I can't tell...it's all
dark in me. I know you did what you thought best...if
I had been there, I believe I should have asked you
to do it...but I wish to God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him sobbingly. "Oh, I ought never
to have let you love me! I ought to have seen that I
was cut off from you forever. I have brought you
wretchedness when I would have given my life for
you! I don't deserve that you should forgive me
for that."</p>

<p>Her sudden outbreak seemed to restore his self-possession.
He went up to her and took her hand with
a quieting touch.</p>

<p>"There is no question of forgiveness, Justine. Don't
let us torture each other with vain repinings. Our
business is to face the thing, and we shall be better for
having talked it out. I shall be better, for my part,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[p 543]</a></span>
for having told Mr. Langhope. But before I go I
want to be sure that you understand the view he may
take...and the effect it will probably have on our
future."</p>

<p>"Our future?" She started. "No, I don't understand."</p>

<p>Amherst paused a moment, as if trying to choose the
words least likely to pain her. "Mr. Langhope knows
that my marriage was...unhappy; through my fault,
he no doubt thinks. And if he chooses to infer that...that
you and I may have cared for each other...before...and
that it was <i>because</i> there was a chance of
recovery that you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We must face it," he repeated inflexibly. "And
you must understand that, if there is the faintest hint
of this kind, I shall give up everything here, as soon as
it can be settled legally&mdash;God, how Tredegar will like
the job!&mdash;and you and I will have to go and begin life
over again...somewhere else."</p>

<p>For an instant a mad hope swelled in her&mdash;the vision
of escaping with him into new scenes, a new life, away
from the coil of memories that bound them down as
in a net. But the reaction of reason came at once&mdash;she
saw him cut off from his chosen work, his career destroyed,
his honour clouded, above all&mdash;ah, this was
what wrung them both!&mdash;his task undone, his people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[p 544]</a></span>
flung back into the depths from which he had lifted
them. And all through her doing&mdash;all because she
had clutched at happiness with too rash a hand! The
thought stung her to passionate activity of mind&mdash;made
her resolve to risk anything, dare anything, before she
involved him farther in her own ruin. She felt her
brain clear gradually, and the thickness dissolve in her
throat.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said in a low voice, raising her
eyes to his.</p>

<p>"And you're ready to accept the consequences?
Think again before it's too late."</p>

<p>She paused. "That is what I should like...what
I wanted to ask you...the time to think."</p>

<p>She saw a slight shade cross his face, as if he had not
expected this failure of courage in her; but he said
quietly: "You don't want me to go today?"</p>

<p>"Not today&mdash;give me one more day."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>She laid a timid hand on his arm. "Please go out to
Westmore as usual&mdash;as if nothing had happened. And
tonight...when you come back...I shall have
decided."</p>

<p>"Very well," he repeated.</p>

<p>"You'll be gone all day?"</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch. "Yes&mdash;I had meant to be;
unless&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[p 545]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I would rather be alone. Good-bye," she
said, letting her hand slip softly along his coat-sleeve
as he turned to the door.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVIII" id="XXXVIII"></a>XXXVIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> half-past six that afternoon, just as Amherst,
on his return from the mills, put the key into his
door at Hanaford, Mrs. Ansell, in New York, was
being shown into Mr. Langhope's library.</p>

<p>As she entered, her friend rose from his chair by the
fire, and turned on her a face so disordered by emotion
that she stopped short with an exclamation of alarm.</p>

<p>"Henry&mdash;what has happened? Why did you send
for me?"</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't go to you. I couldn't trust
myself in the streets&mdash;in the light of day."</p>

<p>"But why? What is it?&mdash;Not Cicely&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He struck both hands upward with a comprehensive
gesture. "Cicely&mdash;everyone&mdash;the whole world!" His
clenched fist came down on the table against which he
was leaning. "Maria, my girl might have been saved!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell looked at him with growing perturbation.
"Saved&mdash;Bessy's life? But how? By whom?"</p>

<p>"She might have been allowed to live, I mean&mdash;to
recover. She was killed, Maria; that woman killed
her!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[p 546]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, with another cry of bewilderment, let
herself drop helplessly into the nearest chair. "In
heaven's name, Henry&mdash;what woman?"</p>

<p>He seated himself opposite to her, clutching at his
stick, and leaning his weight heavily on it&mdash;a white
dishevelled old man. "I wonder why you ask&mdash;just to
spare me?"</p>

<p>Their eyes met in a piercing exchange of question
and answer, and Mrs. Ansell tried to bring out reasonably:
"I ask in order to understand what you are
saying."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you insist on keeping up appearances&mdash;my
daughter-in-law killed my daughter. There you
have it." He laughed silently, with a tear on his reddened
eye-lids.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell groaned. "Henry, you are raving&mdash;I
understand less and less."</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can speak more plainly. She
told me so herself, in this room, not an hour ago."</p>

<p>"She told you? Who told you?"</p>

<p>"John Amherst's wife. Told me she'd killed my
child. It's as easy as breathing&mdash;if you know how to
use a morphia-needle."</p>

<p>Light seemed at last to break on his hearer. "Oh,
my poor Henry&mdash;you mean&mdash;she gave too much?
There was some dreadful accident?"</p>

<p>"There was no accident. She killed my child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[p 547]</a></span>&mdash;killed
her deliberately. Don't look at me as if I were
a madman. She sat in that chair you're in when she
told me."</p>

<p>"Justine? Has she been here today?" Mrs. Ansell
paused in a painful effort to readjust her thoughts.
"But <i>why</i> did she tell you?"</p>

<p>"That's simple enough. To prevent Wyant's doing
it."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;" broke from his hearer, in a long sigh of
fear and intelligence. Mr. Langhope looked at her
with a smile of miserable exultation.</p>

<p>"You knew&mdash;you suspected all along?&mdash;But now
you must speak out!" he exclaimed with a sudden note
of command.</p>

<p>She sat motionless, as if trying to collect herself.
"I know nothing&mdash;I only meant&mdash;why was this never
known before?"</p>

<p>He was upon her at once. "You think&mdash;because
they understood each other? And now there's been
a break between them? He wanted too big a share of
the spoils? Oh, it's all so abysmally vile!"</p>

<p>He covered his face with a shaking hand, and Mrs.
Ansell remained silent, plunged in a speechless misery
of conjecture. At length she regained some measure of
her habitual composure, and leaning forward, with her
eyes on his face, said in a quiet tone: "If I am to help
you, you must try to tell me just what has happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[p 548]</a></span></p>

<p>He made an impatient gesture. "Haven't I told you?
She found that her accomplice meant to speak, and
rushed to town to forestall him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell reflected. "But why&mdash;with his place
at Saint Christopher's secured&mdash;did Dr. Wyant choose
this time to threaten her&mdash;if, as you imagine, he's an
accomplice?"</p>

<p>"Because he's a drug-taker, and she didn't wish him
to have the place."</p>

<p>"She didn't wish it? But that does not look as if
she were afraid. She had only to hold her tongue!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope laughed sardonically. "It's not quite
so simple. Amherst was coming to town to tell me."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;<i>he</i> knows?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and she preferred that I should have her
version first."</p>

<p>"And what is her version?"</p>

<p>The furrows of misery deepened in Mr. Langhope's
face. "Maria&mdash;don't ask too much of me! I can't
go over it again. She says she wanted to spare my child&mdash;she
says the doctors were keeping her alive, torturing
her uselessly, as a...a sort of scientific experiment....
She forced on me the hideous details...."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell waited a moment.</p>

<p>"Well! May it not be true?"</p>

<p>"Wyant's version is different. <i>He</i> says Bessy would
have recovered&mdash;he says Garford thought so too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[p 549]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what does she answer? She denies it?"</p>

<p>"No. She admits that Garford was in doubt. But
she says the chance was too remote&mdash;the pain too bad...that's
her cue, naturally!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, leaning back in her chair, with hands
meditatively stretched along its arms, gave herself up
to silent consideration of the fragmentary statements
cast before her. The long habit of ministering to her
friends in moments of perplexity and distress had given
her an almost judicial keenness in disentangling and
coordinating facts incoherently presented, and in seizing
on the thread of motive that connected them; but she
had never before been confronted with a situation so
poignant in itself, and bearing so intimately on her personal
feelings; and she needed time to free her thoughts
from the impending rush of emotion.</p>

<p>At last she raised her head and said: "Why did Mr.
Amherst let her come to you, instead of coming himself?"</p>

<p>"He knows nothing of her being here. She persuaded
him to wait a day, and as soon as he had gone
to the mills this morning she took the first train to
town."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;&mdash;" Mrs. Ansell murmured thoughtfully; and
Mr. Langhope rejoined, with a conclusive gesture:
"Do you want more proofs of panic-stricken guilt?"</p>

<p>"Oh, guilt&mdash;" His friend revolved her large soft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[p 550]</a></span>
muff about a drooping hand. "There's so much still
to understand."</p>

<p>"Your mind does not, as a rule, work so slowly!"
he said with some asperity; but she paid no heed to his
tone.</p>

<p>"Amherst, for instance&mdash;how long has he known
of this?" she continued.</p>

<p>"A week or two only&mdash;she made that clear."</p>

<p>"And what is his attitude?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;that, I conjecture, is just what she means to
keep us from knowing!"</p>

<p>"You mean she's afraid&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope gathered his haggard brows in a
frown. "She's afraid, of course&mdash;mortally&mdash;I never
saw a woman more afraid. I only wonder she had the
courage to face me."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;that's it! Why <i>did</i> she face you? To extenuate
her act&mdash;to give you her version, because she
feared his might be worse? Do you gather that that
was her motive?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Langhope's turn to hesitate. He furrowed
the thick Turkey rug with the point of his ebony
stick, pausing once or twice to revolve it gimlet-like in
a gap of the pile.</p>

<p>"Not her avowed motive, naturally."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;at least, then, let me have that."</p>

<p>"Her avowed motive? Oh, she'd prepared one, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[p 551]</a></span>
course&mdash;trust her to have a dozen ready! The one she
produced was&mdash;simply the desire to protect her husband."</p>

<p>"Her husband? Does <i>he</i> too need protection?"</p>

<p>"My God, if he takes her side&mdash;&mdash;! At any rate,
her fear seemed to be that what she had done might
ruin him; might cause him to feel&mdash;as well he may!&mdash;that
the mere fact of being her husband makes his situation
as Cicely's step-father, as my son-in-law, intolerable.
And she came to clear him, as it were&mdash;to find
out, in short, on what terms I should be willing to continue
my present relations with him as though this hideous
thing had not been known to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell raised her head quickly. "Well&mdash;and
what were your terms?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. "She spared me the pain of proposing
any&mdash;I had only to accept hers."</p>

<p>"Hers?"</p>

<p>"That she should disappear altogether from my
sight&mdash;and from the child's, naturally. Good heaven,
I should like to include Amherst in that! But I'm
tied hand and foot, as you see, by Cicely's interests;
and I'm bound to say she exonerated him completely&mdash;completely!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell was again silent, but a swift flight of
thoughts traversed her drooping face. "But if you are
to remain on the old terms with her husband, how is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[p 552]</a></span>
she to disappear out of your life without also disappearing
out of his?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope gave a slight laugh. "I leave her
to work out that problem."</p>

<p>"And you think Amherst will consent to such conditions?"</p>

<p>"He's not to know of them."</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of the reply reduced Mrs. Ansell
to a sound of inarticulate interrogation; and Mr.
Langhope continued: "Not at first, that is. She had
thought it all out&mdash;foreseen everything; and she wrung
from me&mdash;I don't yet know how!&mdash;a promise that when
I saw him I would make it appear that I cleared him
completely, not only of any possible complicity, or
whatever you choose to call it, but of any sort of connection
with the matter in my thoughts of him. I am,
in short, to let him feel that he and I are to continue
on the old footing&mdash;and I agreed, on the condition of
her effacing herself somehow&mdash;of course on some other
pretext."</p>

<p>"Some other pretext? But what conceivable pretext?
My poor friend, he adores her!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope raised his eyebrows slightly. "We
haven't seen him since this became known to him.
<i>She</i> has; and she let slip that he was horror-struck."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell looked up with a quick exclamation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[p 553]</a></span>
"Let slip? Isn't it much more likely that she forced
it on you&mdash;emphasized it to the last limit of credulity?"
She sank her hands to the arms of the chair,
and exclaimed, looking him straight in the eyes:
"You say she was frightened? It strikes me she was
dauntless!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope stared a moment; then he said, with
an ironic shrug: "No doubt, then, she counted on its
striking me too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell breathed a shuddering sigh. "Oh, I
understand your feeling as you do&mdash;I'm deep in the
horror of it myself. But I can't help seeing that this
woman might have saved herself&mdash;and that she's chosen
to save her husband instead. What I don't see, from
what I know of him," she musingly proceeded, "is
how, on any imaginable pretext, she will induce him
to accept the sacrifice."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope made a resentful movement. "If
that's the only point your mind dwells on&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell looked up. "It doesn't dwell anywhere
as yet&mdash;except, my poor Henry," she murmured, rising
to move toward him, and softly laying her hand on his
bent shoulder&mdash;"except on your distress and misery&mdash;on
the very part I can't yet talk of, can't question you
about...."</p>

<p>He let her hand rest there a moment; then he turned,
and drawing it into his own tremulous fingers, pressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[p 554]</a></span>
it silently, with a clinging helpless grasp that drew the
tears to her eyes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Justine Brent, in her earliest girlhood, had gone
through one of those emotional experiences that are the
infantile diseases of the heart. She had fancied herself
beloved of a youth of her own age; had secretly returned
his devotion, and had seen it reft from her by
another. Such an incident, as inevitable as the measles,
sometimes, like that mild malady, leaves traces out of
all proportion to its actual virulence. The blow fell on
Justine with tragic suddenness, and she reeled under it,
thinking darkly of death, and renouncing all hopes of
future happiness. Her ready pen often beguiled her
into recording her impressions, and she now found
an escape from despair in writing the history of a
damsel similarly wronged. In her tale, the heroine
killed herself; but the author, saved by this vicarious
sacrifice, lived, and in time even smiled over her
manuscript.</p>

<p>It was many years since Justine Amherst had recalled
this youthful incident; but the memory of it recurred
to her as she turned from Mr. Langhope's door. For
a moment death seemed the easiest escape from what
confronted her; but though she could no longer medicine
her despair by turning it into fiction, she knew at
once that she must somehow transpose it into terms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[p 555]</a></span>
action, that she must always escape from life into more
life, and not into its negation.</p>

<p>She had been carried into Mr. Langhope's presence
by that expiatory passion which still burns so high, and
draws its sustenance from so deep down, in the unsleeping
hearts of women. Though she had never wavered
in her conviction that her act had been justified
her ideas staggered under the sudden comprehension of
its consequences. Not till that morning had she seen
those consequences in their terrible, unsuspected extent,
had she understood how one stone rashly loosened
from the laboriously erected structure of human society
may produce remote fissures in that clumsy fabric.
She saw that, having hazarded the loosening of the
stone, she should have held herself apart from ordinary
human ties, like some priestess set apart for the service
of the temple. And instead, she had seized happiness
with both hands, taken it as the gift of the very fate she
had herself precipitated! She remembered some old
Greek saying to the effect that the gods never forgive
the mortal who presumes to love and suffer like a god.
She had dared to do both, and the gods were bringing
ruin on that deeper self which had its life in those about
her.</p>

<p>So much had become clear to her when she heard
Amherst declare his intention of laying the facts before
Mr. Langhope. His few broken words lit up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[p 556]</a></span>
farthest verge of their lives. She saw that his retrospective
reverence for his wife's memory, which was far as
possible removed from the strong passion of the mind
and senses that bound him to herself, was indelibly
stained and desecrated by the discovery that all he had
received from the one woman had been won for him
by the deliberate act of the other. This was what no
reasoning, no appeal to the calmer judgment, could ever,
in his inmost thoughts, undo or extenuate. It could
find appeasement only in the renunciation of all that
had come to him from Bessy; and this renunciation, so
different from the mere sacrifice of material well-being,
was bound up with consequences so far-reaching, so
destructive to the cause which had inspired his whole
life, that Justine felt the helpless terror of the mortal
who has launched one of the heavenly bolts.</p>

<p>She could think of no way of diverting it but the way
she had chosen. She must see Mr. Langhope first,
must clear Amherst of the least faint association with
her act or her intention. And to do this she must exaggerate,
not her own compunction&mdash;for she could not
depart from the exact truth in reporting her feelings
and convictions&mdash;but her husband's first instinctive
movement of horror, the revulsion of feeling her confession
had really produced in him. This was the most
painful part of her task, and for this reason her excited
imagination clothed it with a special expiatory value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[p 557]</a></span>
If she could purchase Amherst's peace of mind, and the
security of his future, by confessing, and even over-emphasizing,
the momentary estrangement between them
there would be a bitter joy in such payment!</p>

<p>Her hour with Mr. Langhope proved the correctness
of her intuition. She could save Amherst only by
effacing herself from his life: those about him would be
only too ready to let her bear the full burden of obloquy.
She could see that, for a dozen reasons, Mr. Langhope,
even in the first shock of his dismay, unconsciously
craved a way of exonerating Amherst, of preserving
intact the relation on which so much of his comfort had
come to depend. And she had the courage to make
the most of his desire, to fortify it by isolating Amherst's
point of view from hers; so that, when the hour
was over, she had the solace of feeling that she had
completely freed him from any conceivable consequence
of her act.</p>

<p>So far, the impetus of self-sacrifice had carried her
straight to her goal; but, as frequently happens with such
atoning impulses, it left her stranded just short of any
subsequent plan of conduct. Her next step, indeed,
was clear enough: she must return to Hanaford, explain
to her husband that she had felt impelled to tell
her own story to Mr. Langhope, and then take up her
ordinary life till chance offered her a pretext for fulfilling
her promise. But what pretext was likely to pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[p 558]</a></span>sent
itself? No symbolic horn would sound the hour
of fulfillment; she must be her own judge, and hear the
call in the depths of her own conscience.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIX" id="XXXIX"></a>XXXIX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Amherst, returning late that afternoon
from Westmore, learned of his wife's departure,
and read the note she had left, he found it, for a time,
impossible to bring order out of the confusion of feeling
produced in him.</p>

<p>His mind had been disturbed enough before. All
day, through the routine of work at the mills, he had
laboured inwardly with the difficulties confronting him;
and his unrest had been increased by the fact that his
situation bore an ironic likeness to that in which, from
a far different cause, he had found himself at the other
crisis of his life. Once more he was threatened with
the possibility of having to give up Westmore, at a moment
when concentration of purpose and persistency
of will were at last beginning to declare themselves in
tangible results. Before, he had only given up
dreams; now it was their fruition that he was asked
to surrender. And he was fixed in his resolve to
withdraw absolutely from Westmore if the statement
he had to make to Mr. Langhope was received with the
least hint of an offensive mental reservation. All forms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[p 559]</a></span>
of moral compromise had always been difficult to Amherst,
and like many men absorbed in large and complicated
questions he craved above all clearness and
peace in his household relation. The first months of
his second marriage had brought him, as a part of
richer and deeper joys, this enveloping sense of a clear
moral medium, in which no subterfuge or equivocation
could draw breath. He had felt that henceforth he
could pour into his work all the combative energy, the
powers of endurance, resistance, renovation, which had
once been unprofitably dissipated in the vain attempt
to bring some sort of harmony into life with Bessy.
Between himself and Justine, apart from their love for
each other, there was the wider passion for their kind,
which gave back to them an enlarged and deepened reflection
of their personal feeling. In such an air it had
seemed that no petty egotism could hamper their growth,
no misintelligence obscure their love; yet all the while
this pure happiness had been unfolding against a sordid
background of falsehood and intrigue from which
his soul turned with loathing.</p>

<p>Justine was right in assuming that Amherst had never
thought much about women. He had vaguely regarded
them as meant to people that hazy domain of feeling designed
to offer the busy man an escape from thought.
His second marriage, leading him to the blissful discovery
that woman can think as well as feel, that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[p 560]</a></span>
are beings of the ornamental sex in whom brain and
heart have so enlarged each other that their emotions
are as clear as thought, their thoughts as warm as emotions&mdash;this
discovery had had the effect of making him
discard his former summary conception of woman as
a bundle of inconsequent impulses, and admit her at a
stroke to full mental equality with her lord. The result
of this act of manumission was, that in judging
Justine he could no longer allow for what was purely
feminine in her conduct. It was incomprehensible to
him that she, to whom truth had seemed the essential
element of life, should have been able to draw breath,
and find happiness, in an atmosphere of falsehood and
dissimulation. His mind could assent&mdash;at least in the
abstract&mdash;to the reasonableness of her act; but he was
still unable to understand her having concealed it from
him. He could enter far enough into her feelings to
allow for her having kept silence on his first return to
Lynbrook, when she was still under the strain of a prolonged
and terrible trial; but that she should have continued
to do so when he and she had discovered and
confessed their love for each other, threw an intolerable
doubt on her whole course.</p>

<p>He stayed late at the mills, finding one pretext after
another for delaying his return to Hanaford, and trying,
while he gave one part of his mind to the methodical
performance of his task, to adjust the other to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[p 561]</a></span>
definite view of the future. But all was darkened and
confused by the sense that, between himself and Justine,
complete communion of thought was no longer possible.
It had, in fact, never existed; there had always been a
locked chamber in her mind, and he knew not yet what
other secrets might inhabit it.</p>

<p>The shock of finding her gone when he reached home
gave a new turn to his feelings. She had made no
mystery of her destination, leaving word with the servants
that she had gone to town to see Mr. Langhope;
and Amherst found a note from her on his study
table.</p>

<p>"I feel," she wrote, "that I ought to see Mr. Langhope
myself, and be the first to tell him what must be
told. It was like you, dearest, to wish to spare me
this, but it would have made me more unhappy; and
Mr. Langhope might wish to hear the facts in my own
words. I shall come back tomorrow, and after that it
will be for you to decide what must be done."</p>

<p>The brevity and simplicity of the note were characteristic;
in moments of high tension Justine was always
calm and direct. And it was like her, too, not to
make any covert appeal to his sympathy, not to seek to
entrap his judgment by caressing words and plaintive
allusions. The quiet tone in which she stated her purpose
matched the firmness and courage of the act, and
for a moment Amherst was shaken by a revulsion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[p 562]</a></span>
of feeling. Her heart was level with his, after all&mdash;if
she had done wrong she would bear the brunt of it
alone. It was so exactly what he himself would have
felt and done in such a situation that faith in her flowed
back through all the dried channels of his heart. But
an instant later the current set the other way. The
wretched years of his first marriage had left in him a
residue of distrust, a tendency to dissociate every act
from its ostensible motive. He had been too profoundly
the dupe of his own enthusiasm not to retain
this streak of scepticism, and it now moved him
to ask if Justine's sudden departure had not been
prompted by some other cause than the one she avowed.
Had that alone actuated her, why not have told it to
him, and asked his consent to her plan? Why let him
leave the house without a hint of her purpose, and slip
off by the first train as soon as he was safe at Westmore?
Might it not be that she had special reasons for wishing
Mr. Langhope to <i>hear her own version first</i>&mdash;that there
were questions she wished to parry herself, explanations
she could trust no one to make for her? The
thought plunged Amherst into deeper misery. He
knew not how to defend himself against these disintegrating
suspicions&mdash;he felt only that, once the accord
between two minds is broken, it is less easy to restore
than the passion between two hearts. He dragged
heavily through his solitary evening, and awaited with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[p 563]</a></span>
dread and yet impatience a message announcing his
wife's return.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It would have been easier&mdash;far easier&mdash;when she left
Mr. Langhope's door, to go straight out into the darkness
and let it close in on her for good.</p>

<p>Justine felt herself yielding to the spell of that
suggestion as she walked along the lamplit pavement,
hardly conscious of the turn her steps were taking.
The door of the house which a few weeks before had
been virtually hers had closed on her without a question.
She had been suffered to go out into the darkness
without being asked whither she was going, or
under what roof her night would be spent. The contrast
between her past and present sounded through
the tumult of her thoughts like the evil laughter of
temptation. The house at Hanaford, to which she
was returning, would look at her with the same alien
face&mdash;nowhere on earth, at that moment, was a door
which would open to her like the door of home.</p>

<p>In her painful self-absorption she followed the side
street toward Madison Avenue, and struck southward
down that tranquil thoroughfare. There was a physical
relief in rapid motion, and she walked on, still hardly
aware of her direction, toward the clustered lights of
Madison Square. Should she return to Hanaford, she
had still several hours to dispose of before the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[p 564]</a></span>parture
of the midnight train; and if she did not return,
hours and dates no longer existed for her.</p>

<p>It would be easier&mdash;infinitely easier&mdash;not to go back.
To take up her life with Amherst would, under any
circumstances, be painful enough; to take it up under
the tacit restriction of her pledge to Mr. Langhope
seemed more than human courage could face. As she
approached the square she had almost reached the
conclusion that such a temporary renewal was beyond
her strength&mdash;beyond what any standard of duty exacted.
The question of an alternative hardly troubled
her. She would simply go on living, and find an escape
in work and material hardship. It would not be hard
for so inconspicuous a person to slip back into the obscure
mass of humanity.</p>

<p>She paused a moment on the edge of the square,
vaguely seeking a direction for her feet that might permit
the working of her thoughts to go on uninterrupted;
and as she stood there, her eyes fell on the bench near
the corner of Twenty-sixth Street, where she had sat
with Amherst on the day of his flight from Lynbrook.
He too had dreamed of escaping from insoluble problems
into the clear air of hard work and simple duties;
and she remembered the words with which she had turned
him back. The cases, of course, were not identical,
since he had been flying in anger and wounded pride
from a situation for which he was in no wise to blame;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[p 565]</a></span>
yet, if even at such a moment she had insisted on charity
and forbearance, how could she now show less self-denial
than she had exacted of him?</p>

<p>"If you go away for a time, surely it ought to be in
such a way that your going does not seem to cast any
reflection on Bessy...." That was how she had put it
to him, and how, with the mere change of a name, she
must now, for reasons as cogent, put it to herself.
It was just as much a part of the course she had
planned to return to her husband now, and take up
their daily life together, as it would, later on, be her
duty to drop out of that life, when her doing so could
no longer involve him in the penalty to be paid.</p>

<p>She stood a little while looking at the bench on which
they had sat, and giving thanks in her heart for the past
strength which was now helping to build up her failing
courage: such a patchwork business are our best
endeavours, yet so faithfully does each weak upward
impulse reach back a hand to the next.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Justine's explanation of her visit to Mr. Langhope
was not wholly satisfying to her husband. She did not
conceal from him that the scene had been painful, but
she gave him to understand, as briefly as possible, that
Mr. Langhope, after his first movement of uncontrollable
distress, had seemed able to make allowances for
the pressure under which she had acted, and that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[p 566]</a></span>
had, at any rate, given no sign of intending to let her
confession make any change in the relation between the
households. If she did not&mdash;as Amherst afterward recalled&mdash;put
all this specifically into words, she contrived
to convey it in her manner, in her allusions, above
all in her recovered composure. She had the demeanour
of one who has gone through a severe test of strength,
but come out of it in complete control of the situation.
There was something slightly unnatural in this prompt
solution of so complicated a difficulty, and it had the
effect of making Amherst ask himself what, to produce
such a result, must have been the gist of her communication
to Mr. Langhope. If the latter had shown
any disposition to be cruel, or even unjust, Amherst's
sympathies would have rushed instantly to his wife's
defence; but the fact that there was apparently to be
no call on them left his reason free to compare and
discriminate, with the final result that the more he
pondered on his father-in-law's attitude the less intelligible
it became.</p>

<p>A few days after Justine's return he was called to
New York on business; and before leaving he told her
that he should of course take the opportunity of having
a talk with Mr. Langhope.</p>

<p>She received the statement with the gentle composure
from which she had not departed since her return from
town; and he added tentatively, as if to provoke her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[p 567]</a></span>
a clearer expression of feeling: "I shall not be satisfied,
of course, till I see for myself just how he feels&mdash;just
how much, at bottom, this has affected him&mdash;since my
own future relation to him will, as I have already told
you, depend entirely on his treatment of you."</p>

<p>She met this without any sign of disturbance. "His
treatment of me was very kind," she said. "But would
it not, on your part," she continued hesitatingly, "be
kinder not to touch on the subject so soon again?"</p>

<p>The line deepened between his brows. "Touch on
it? I sha'n't rest till I've gone to the bottom of it! Till
then, you must understand," he summed up with decision,
"I feel myself only on sufferance here at Westmore."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I understand," she assented; and as he bent
over to kiss her for goodbye a tenuous impenetrable
barrier seemed to lie between their lips.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was Justine's turn to await with a passionate anxiety
her husband's home-coming; and when, on the
third day, he reappeared, her dearly acquired self-control
gave way to a tremulous eagerness. This was,
after all, the turning-point in their lives: everything depended
on how Mr. Langhope had "played up" to his
cue; had kept to his side of their bond.</p>

<p>Amherst's face showed signs of emotional havoc:
when feeling once broke out in him it had full play,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[p 568]</a></span>
and she could see that his hour with Mr. Langhope had
struck to the roots of life. But the resultant expression
was one of invigoration, not defeat; and she gathered
at a glance that her partner had not betrayed her. She
drew a tragic solace from the success of her achievement;
yet it flung her into her husband's arms with a
passion of longing to which, as she instantly felt, he
did not as completely respond.</p>

<p>There was still, then, something "between" them:
somewhere the mechanism of her scheme had failed, or
its action had not produced the result she had counted
on.</p>

<p>As soon as they were alone in the study she said, as
quietly as she could: "You saw your father-in-law?
You talked with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I spent the afternoon with him. Cicely sent
you her love."</p>

<p>She coloured at the mention of the child's name and
murmured: "And Mr. Langhope?"</p>

<p>"He is perfectly calm now&mdash;perfectly impartial.&mdash;This
business has made me feel," Amherst added
abruptly, "that I have never been quite fair to him. I
never thought him a magnanimous man."</p>

<p>"He has proved himself so," Justine murmured, her
head bent low over a bit of needlework; and Amherst
affirmed energetically: "He has been more than that&mdash;generous!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[p 569]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up at him with a smile. "I am so glad,
dear; so glad there is not to be the least shadow between
you...."</p>

<p>"No," Amherst said, his voice flagging slightly.
There was a pause, and then he went on with renewed
emphasis: "Of course I made my point clear to him."</p>

<p>"Your point?"</p>

<p>"That I stand or fall by his judgment of you."</p>

<p>Oh, if he had but said it more tenderly! But he delivered
it with the quiet resolution of a man who contends
for an abstract principle of justice, and not for a
passion grown into the fibres of his heart!</p>

<p>"You are generous too," she faltered, her voice
trembling a little.</p>

<p>Amherst frowned; and she perceived that any hint,
on her part, of recognizing the slightest change in their
relations was still like pressure on a painful bruise.</p>

<p>"There is no need for such words between us," he
said impatiently; "and Mr. Langhope's attitude," he
added, with an effort at a lighter tone, "has made it unnecessary,
thank heaven, that we should ever revert to
the subject again."</p>

<p>He turned to his desk as he spoke, and plunged into
perusal of the letters that had accumulated in his absence.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was a temporary excess of work at Westmore,
and during the days that followed he threw himself into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[p 570]</a></span>
it with a zeal that showed Justine how eagerly he sought
any pretext for avoiding confidential moments. The
perception was painful enough, yet not as painful as
another discovery that awaited her. She too had her
tasks at Westmore: the supervision of the hospital, the
day nursery, the mothers' club, and the various other
organizations whereby she and Amherst were trying
to put some sort of social unity into the lives of the mill-hands;
and when, on the day after his return from New
York, she presented herself, as usual, at the Westmore
office, where she was in the habit of holding a brief consultation
with him before starting on her rounds, she
was at once aware of a new tinge of constraint in his
manner. It hurt him, then, to see her at Westmore&mdash;hurt
him more than to live with her, at Hanaford, under
Bessy's roof! For it was there, at the mills, that his real
life was led, the life with which Justine had been most
identified, the life that had been made possible for both
by the magnanimity of that other woman whose presence
was now forever between them.</p>

<p>Justine made no sign. She resumed her work as
though unconscious of any change; but whereas in the
past they had always found pretexts for seeking each
other out, to discuss the order of the day's work, or
merely to warm their hearts by a rapid word or two,
now each went a separate way, sometimes not meeting
till they regained the house at night-fall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[p 571]</a></span></p>

<p>And as the weeks passed she began to understand
that, by a strange inversion of probability, the relation
between Amherst and herself was to be the means of
holding her to her compact with Mr. Langhope&mdash;if
indeed it were not nearer the truth to say that it had
made such a compact unnecessary. Amherst had
done his best to take up their life together as though
there had been no break in it; but slowly the fact was
being forced on her that by remaining with him she
was subjecting him to intolerable suffering&mdash;was coming
to be the personification of the very thoughts and
associations from which he struggled to escape. Happily
her promptness of action had preserved Westmore
to him, and in Westmore she believed that he would in
time find a refuge from even the memory of what he
was now enduring. But meanwhile her presence kept
the thought alive; and, had every other incentive lost
its power, this would have been enough to sustain her.
Fate had, ironically enough, furnished her with an unanswerable
reason for leaving Amherst; the impossibility
of their keeping up such a relation as now existed
between them would soon become too patent to be denied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as summer approached, she knew that
external conditions would also call upon her to act.
The visible signal for her withdrawal would be Cicely's
next visit to Westmore. The child's birthday fell in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[p 572]</a></span>
early June; and Amherst, some months previously, had
asked that she should be permitted to spend it at Hanaford,
and that it should be chosen as the date for the
opening of the first model cottages at Hopewood.</p>

<p>It was Justine who had originated the idea of associating
Cicely's anniversaries with some significant moment
in the annals of the mill colony; and struck by the
happy suggestion, he had at once applied himself to
hastening on the work at Hopewood. The eagerness
of both Amherst and Justine that Cicely should be
identified with the developing life of Westmore had
been one of the chief influences in reconciling Mr.
Langhope to his son-in-law's second marriage. Husband
and wife had always made it clear that they regarded
themselves as the mere trustees of the Westmore
revenues, and that Cicely's name should, as early
as possible, be associated with every measure taken for
the welfare of the people. But now, as Justine knew,
the situation was changed; and Cicely would not be allowed
to come to Hanaford until she herself had left it.
The manifold threads of divination that she was perpetually
throwing out in Amherst's presence told her,
without word or sign on his part, that he also awaited
Cicely's birthday as a determining date in their lives.
He spoke confidently, and as a matter of course, of
Mr. Langhope's bringing his grand-daughter at the
promised time; but Justine could hear a note of chal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[p 573]</a></span>lenge
in his voice, as though he felt that Mr. Langhope's
sincerity had not yet been put to the test.</p>

<p>As the time drew nearer it became more difficult for
her to decide just how she should take the step she had
determined on. She had no material anxiety for the
future, for although she did not mean to accept a penny
from her husband after she had left him, she knew it
would be easy for her to take up her nursing again;
and she knew also that her hospital connections would
enable her to find work in a part of the country far
enough distant to remove her entirely from his life.
But she had not yet been able to invent a reason for
leaving that should be convincing enough to satisfy him,
without directing his suspicions to the truth. As she
revolved the question she suddenly recalled an exclamation
of Amherst's&mdash;a word spoken as they entered Mr.
Langhope's door, on the fatal afternoon when she had
found Wyant's letter awaiting her.</p>

<p>"There's nothing you can't make people believe,
you little Jesuit!"</p>

<p>She had laughed in pure joy at his praise of her; for
every bantering phrase had then been a caress. But
now the words returned with a sinister meaning. She
knew they were true as far as Amherst was concerned:
in the arts of casuistry and equivocation a child could
have outmatched him, and she had only to exert her
will to dupe him as deeply as she pleased. Well!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[p 574]</a></span>
the task was odious, but it was needful: it was the bitterest
part of her expiation that she must deceive him once
more to save him from the results of her former deception.
This decision once reached, every nerve in her
became alert for an opportunity to do the thing and have
it over; so that, whenever they were alone together, she
was in an attitude of perpetual tension, her whole mind
drawn up for its final spring.</p>

<p>The decisive word came, one evening toward the end
of May, in the form of an allusion on Amherst's part
to Cicely's approaching visit. Husband and wife were
seated in the drawing-room after dinner, he with a book
in hand, she bending, as usual, over the needlework
which served at once as a pretext for lowered eyes, and
as a means of disguising her fixed preoccupation.</p>

<p>"Have you worked out a plan?" he asked, laying
down his book. "It occurred to me that it would
be rather a good idea if we began with a sort of festivity
for the kids at the day nursery. You could take Cicely
there early, and I could bring out Mr. Langhope after
luncheon. The whole performance would probably
tire him too much."</p>

<p>Justine listened with suspended thread. "Yes&mdash;that
seems a good plan."</p>

<p>"Will you see about the details, then? You know
it's only a week off."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know." She hesitated, and then took the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[p 575]</a></span>
spring. "I ought to tell you John&mdash;that I&mdash;I think I
may not be here...."</p>

<p>He raised his head abruptly, and she saw the blood
mount under his fair skin. "Not be here?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She met his look as steadily as she could. "I think
of going away for awhile."</p>

<p>"Going away? Where? What is the matter&mdash;are
you not well?"</p>

<p>There was her pretext&mdash;he had found it for her!
Why should she not simply plead ill-health? Afterward
she would find a way of elaborating the details
and making them plausible. But suddenly, as she was
about to speak, there came to her the feeling which, up
to one fatal moment in their lives, had always ruled
their intercourse&mdash;the feeling that there must be truth,
and absolute truth, between them. Absolute, indeed, it
could never be again, since he must never know of the
condition exacted by Mr. Langhope; but that, at the
moment, seemed almost a secondary motive compared
to the deeper influences that were inexorably forcing
them apart. At any rate, she would trump up no
trivial excuse for the step she had resolved on; there
should be truth, if not the whole truth, in this last decisive
hour between them.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am quite well&mdash;at least my body is," she said
quietly. "But I am tired, perhaps; my mind has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[p 576]</a></span>
going round too long in the same circle." She paused
for a brief space, and then, raising her head, and
looking him straight in the eyes: "Has it not been so
with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>The question seemed to startle Amherst. He rose
from his chair and took a few steps toward the hearth,
where a small fire was crumbling into embers. He
turned his back to it, resting an arm on the mantel-shelf;
then he said, in a somewhat unsteady tone: "I
thought we had agreed not to speak of all that again."</p>

<p>Justine shook her head with a fugitive half-smile.
"I made no such agreement. And besides, what is the
use, when we can always hear each other's thoughts
speak, and they speak of nothing else?"</p>

<p>Amherst's brows darkened. "It is not so with mine,"
he began; but she raised her hand with a silencing
gesture.</p>

<p>"I know you have tried your best that it should not
be so; and perhaps you have succeeded better than I.
But I am tired, horribly tired&mdash;I want to get away from
everything!"</p>

<p>She saw a look of pain in his eyes. He continued
to lean against the mantel-shelf, his head slightly lowered,
his unseeing gaze fixed on a remote scroll in the
pattern of the carpet; then he said in a low tone: "I
can only repeat again what I have said before&mdash;that I
understand why you did what you did."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[p 577]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," she answered, in the same tone.</p>

<p>There was another pause, for she could not trust herself
to go on speaking; and presently he asked, with a
tinge of bitterness in his voice: "That does not satisfy
you?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "It satisfies me as much as it does
you&mdash;and no more," she replied at length.</p>

<p>He looked up hastily. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I say. We can neither of us go on living
on that understanding just at present." She rose as
she spoke, and crossed over to the hearth. "I want to
go back to my nursing&mdash;to go out to Michigan, to a
town where I spent a few months the year before I first
came to Hanaford. I have friends there, and can get
work easily. And you can tell people that I was ill
and needed a change."</p>

<p>It had been easier to say than she had imagined, and
her voice held its clear note till the end; but when she
had ceased, the whole room began to reverberate with
her words, and through the clashing they made in her
brain she felt a sudden uncontrollable longing that they
should provoke in him a cry of protest, of resistance.
Oh, if he refused to let her go&mdash;if he caught her to him,
and defied the world to part them&mdash;what then of her
pledge to Mr. Langhope, what then of her resolve to
pay the penalty alone?</p>

<p>But in the space of a heart-beat she knew that peril<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[p 578]</a></span>&mdash;that
longed-for peril!&mdash;was past. Her husband had
remained silent&mdash;he neither moved toward her nor
looked at her; and she felt in every slackening nerve that
in the end he would let her go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Langhope</span>, tossing down a note on Mrs.
Ansell's drawing-room table, commanded imperiously:
"Read that!"</p>

<p>She set aside her tea-cup, and looked up, not at the
note, but into his face, which was crossed by one of
the waves of heat and tremulousness that she was
beginning to fear for him. Mr. Langhope had changed
greatly in the last three months; and as he stood there
in the clear light of the June afternoon it came to her
that he had at last suffered the sudden collapse which
is the penalty of youth preserved beyond its time.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, still watching him as she
put out her hand for the letter.</p>

<p>"Amherst writes to remind me of my promise to
take Cicely to Hanaford next week, for her birthday."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it was a promise, wasn't it?" she rejoined,
running her eyes over the page.</p>

<p>"A promise&mdash;yes; but made before.... Read the
note&mdash;you'll see there's no reference to his wife. For
all I know, she'll be there to receive us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[p 579]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that was a promise too."</p>

<p>"That neither Cicely nor I should ever set eyes on
her? Yes. But why should she keep it? I was a
fool that day&mdash;she fooled me as she's fooled us all!
But you saw through it from the beginning&mdash;you said
at once that she'd never leave him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell reflected. "I said that before I knew all
the circumstances. Now I think differently."</p>

<p>"You think she still means to go?"</p>

<p>She handed the letter back to him. "I think this is
to tell you so."</p>

<p>"This?" He groped for his glasses, dubiously scanning
the letter again.</p>

<p>"Yes. And what's more, if you refuse to go she'll
have every right to break her side of the agreement."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope sank into a chair, steadying himself
painfully with his stick. "Upon my soul, I sometimes
think you're on her side!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but I like fair play," she returned, measuring
his tea carefully into his favourite little porcelain tea-pot.</p>

<p>"Fair play?"</p>

<p>"She's offering to do her part. It's for you to do
yours now&mdash;to take Cicely to Hanaford."</p>

<p>"If I find her there, I never cross Amherst's threshold
again!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, without answering, rose and put his tea-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[p 580]</a></span>cup
on the slender-legged table at his elbow; then,
before returning to her seat, she found the enamelled
match-box and laid it by the cup. It was becoming
difficult for Mr. Langhope to guide his movements
about her small encumbered room; and he had always
liked being waited on.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Ansell's prognostication proved correct. When
Mr. Langhope and Cicely arrived at Hanaford they
found Amherst alone to receive them. He explained
briefly that his wife had been unwell, and had gone to
seek rest and change at the house of an old friend in
the west. Mr. Langhope expressed a decent amount
of regret, and the subject was dropped as if by common
consent. Cicely, however, was not so easily silenced.
Poor Bessy's uncertain fits of tenderness had produced
more bewilderment than pleasure in her sober-minded
child; but the little girl's feelings and perceptions had
developed rapidly in the equable atmosphere of her
step-mother's affection. Cicely had reached the age
when children put their questions with as much ingenuity
as persistence, and both Mr. Langhope and
Amherst longed for Mrs. Ansell's aid in parrying her
incessant interrogations as to the cause and length of
Justine's absence, what she had said before going,
and what promise she had made about coming back.
But Mrs. Ansell had not come to Hanaford. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[p 581]</a></span>
it had become a matter of habit to include her in the
family pilgrimages to the mills she had firmly maintained
the plea of more urgent engagements; and the
two men, with only Cicely between them, had spent
the long days and longer evenings in unaccustomed and
unmitigated propinquity.</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope, before leaving, thought it proper to
touch tentatively on his promise of giving Cicely to
Amherst for the summer; but to his surprise the latter,
after a moment of hesitation, replied that he should
probably go to Europe for two or three months.</p>

<p>"To Europe? Alone?" escaped from Mr. Langhope
before he had time to weigh his words.</p>

<p>Amherst frowned slightly. "I have been made a
delegate to the Berne conference on the housing of
factory operatives," he said at length, without making
a direct reply to the question; "and if there is
nothing to keep me at Westmore, I shall probably
go out in July." He waited a moment, and then
added: "My wife has decided to spend the summer
in Michigan."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's answer was a vague murmur of
assent, and Amherst turned the talk to other matters.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Langhope returned to town with distinct views on
the situation at Hanaford.</p>

<p>"Poor devil&mdash;I'm sorry for him: he can hardly speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[p 582]</a></span>
of her," he broke out at once to Mrs. Ansell, in the
course of their first confidential hour together.</p>

<p>"Because he cares too much&mdash;he's too unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Because he loathes her!" Mr. Langhope brought
out with emphasis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell drew a deep sigh which made him add
accusingly: "I believe you're actually sorry!"</p>

<p>"Sorry?" She raised her eye-brows with a slight
smile. "Should one not always be sorry to know
there's a little less love and a little more hate in the
world?"</p>

<p>"You'll be asking <i>me</i> not to hate her next!"</p>

<p>She still continued to smile on him. "It's the haters,
not the hated, I'm sorry for," she said at length; and
he flung back impatiently: "Oh, don't let's talk of her.
I sometimes feel she takes up more place in our lives
than when she was with us!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Amherst went to the Berne conference in July, and
spent six weeks afterward in rapid visits to various
industrial centres and model factory villages. During
his previous European pilgrimages his interest had by
no means been restricted to sociological questions:
the appeal of an old civilization, reaching him through
its innumerable forms of tradition and beauty, had
roused that side of his imagination which his work at
home left untouched. But upon his present state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[p 583]</a></span>
deep moral commotion the spells of art and history were
powerless to work. The foundations of his life had
been shaken, and the fair exterior of the world was as
vacant as a maniac's face. He could only take refuge
in his special task, barricading himself against every
expression of beauty and poetry as so many poignant
reminders of a phase of life that he was vainly trying to
cast off and forget.</p>

<p>Even his work had been embittered to him, thrust
out of its place in the ordered scheme of things. It
had cost him a hard struggle to hold fast to his main
purpose, to convince himself that his real duty lay, not
in renouncing the Westmore money and its obligations,
but in carrying out his projected task as if nothing
had occurred to affect his personal relation to it. The
mere fact that such a renunciation would have been
a deliberate moral suicide, a severing once for all of
every artery of action, made it take on, at first, the
semblance of an obligation, a sort of higher duty to
the abstract conception of what he owed himself. But
Justine had not erred in her forecast. Once she had
passed out of his life, it was easier for him to return
to a dispassionate view of his situation, to see, and
boldly confess to himself that he saw, the still higher
duty of sticking to his task, instead of sacrificing it to
any ideal of personal disinterestedness. It was this
gradual process of adjustment that saved him from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[p 584]</a></span>
desolating scepticism which falls on the active man
when the sources of his activity are tainted. Having
accepted his fate, having consented to see in himself
merely the necessary agent of a good to be done, he
could escape from self-questioning only by shutting
himself up in the practical exigencies of his work,
closing his eyes and his thoughts to everything which
had formerly related it to a wider world, had given
meaning and beauty to life as a whole.</p>

<p>The return from Europe, and the taking up of the
daily routine at Hanaford, were the most difficult
phases in this process of moral adaptation.</p>

<p>Justine's departure had at first brought relief. He
had been too sincere with himself to oppose her wish to
leave Hanaford for a time, since he believed that, for
her as well as for himself, a temporary separation
would be less painful than a continuance of their
actual relation. But as the weeks passed into months
he found he was no nearer to a clear view of his own
case: the future was still dark and enigmatic. Justine's
desire to leave him had revived his unformulated
distrust of her. What could it mean but that there
were thoughts within her which could not be at rest
in his presence? He had given her every proof of his
wish to forget the past, and Mr. Langhope had behaved
with unequalled magnanimity. Yet Justine's
unhappiness was evident: she could not conceal her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[p 585]</a></span>
longing to escape from the conditions her act had
created. Was it because, in reality, she was conscious
of other motives than the one she acknowledged? She
had insisted, almost unfeelingly as it might have
seemed, on the abstract rightness of what she had
done, on the fact that, ideally speaking, her act could
not be made less right, less justifiable, by the special
accidental consequences that had flowed from it. Because
these consequences had caught her in a web
of tragic fatality she would not be guilty of the weakness
of tracing back the disaster to any intrinsic error
in her original motive. Why, then, if this was her
real, her proud attitude toward the past&mdash;and since
those about her believed in her sincerity, and accepted
her justification as valid from her point of view if not
from theirs&mdash;why had she not been able to maintain
her posture, to carry on life on the terms she had
exacted from others?</p>

<p>A special circumstance contributed to this feeling of
distrust; the fact, namely, that Justine, a week after
her departure from Hanaford, had written to say that
she could not, from that moment till her return, consent
to accept any money from Amherst. As her
manner was, she put her reasons clearly and soberly,
without evasion or ambiguity.</p>

<p>"Since you and I," she wrote, "have always agreed
in regarding the Westmore money as a kind of wage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[p 586]</a></span>
for our services at the mills, I cannot be satisfied to
go on drawing that wage while I am unable to do any
work in return. I am sure you must feel as I do about
this; and you need have no anxiety as to the practical
side of the question, since I have enough to live on in
some savings from my hospital days, which were invested
for me two years ago by Harry Dressel, and
are beginning to bring in a small return. This being
the case, I feel I can afford to interpret in any way I
choose the terms of the bargain between myself and
Westmore."</p>

<p>On reading this, Amherst's mind had gone through
the strange dual process which now marked all his
judgments of his wife. At first he had fancied he
understood her, and had felt that he should have done
as she did; then the usual reaction of distrust set in,
and he asked himself why she, who had so little of the
conventional attitude toward money, should now develop
this unexpected susceptibility. And so the old
question presented itself in another shape: if she had
nothing to reproach herself for, why was it intolerable
to her to live on Bessy's money? The fact that she
was doing no actual service at Westmore did not account
for her scruples&mdash;she would have been the last
person to think that a sick servant should be docked
of his pay. Her reluctance could come only from that
hidden cause of compunction which had prompted her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[p 587]</a></span>
departure, and which now forced her to sever even
the merely material links between herself and her past.</p>

<p>Amherst, on his return to Hanaford, had tried to
find in these considerations a reason for his deep unrest.
It was his wife's course which still cast a torturing
doubt on what he had braced his will to accept
and put behind him. And he now told himself that
the perpetual galling sense of her absence was due to
this uneasy consciousness of what it meant, of the dark
secrets it enveloped and held back from him. In
actual truth, every particle of his being missed her, he
lacked her at every turn. She had been at once the
partner of his task, and the <i>pays bleu</i> into which he
escaped from it; the vivifying thought which gave
meaning to the life he had chosen, yet never let him
forget that there was a larger richer life outside, to
which he was rooted by deeper and more intrinsic
things than any abstract ideal of altruism. His love
had preserved his identity, saved him from shrinking
into the mere nameless unit which the social enthusiast
is in danger of becoming unless the humanitarian passion
is balanced, and a little overweighed, by a merely
human one. And now this equilibrium was lost forever,
and his deepest pain lay in realizing that he
could not regain it, even by casting off Westmore and
choosing the narrower but richer individual existence
that her love might once have offered. His life was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[p 588]</a></span>
truth one indivisible organism, not two halves artificially
united. Self and other-self were ingrown from
the roots&mdash;whichever portion fate restricted him to
would be but a mutilated half-live fragment of the
whole.</p>

<p>Happily for him, chance made this crisis of his life
coincide with a strike at Westmore. Soon after his
return to Hanaford he found himself compelled to
grapple with the hardest problem of his industrial
career, and he was carried through the ensuing three
months on that tide of swift obligatory action that
sweeps the ship-wrecked spirit over so many sunken
reefs of fear and despair. The knowledge that he was
better able to deal with the question than any one
who might conceivably have taken his place&mdash;this conviction,
which was presently confirmed by the peaceable
adjustment of the strike, helped to make the sense of
his immediate usefulness outbalance that other, disintegrating
doubt as to the final value of such efforts.
And so he tried to settle down into a kind of mechanical
altruism, in which the reflexes of habit should take the
place of that daily renewal of faith and enthusiasm
which had been fed from the springs of his own joy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The autumn came and passed into winter; and after
Mr. Langhope's re-establishment in town Amherst
began to resume his usual visits to his step-daughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[p 589]</a></span></p>

<p>His natural affection for the little girl had been
deepened by the unforeseen manner in which her fate
had been entrusted to him. The thought of Bessy,
softened to compunction by the discovery that her love
had persisted under their apparently hopeless estrangement&mdash;this
feeling, intensified to the verge of morbidness
by the circumstances attending her death, now
sought expression in a passionate devotion to her child.
Accident had, in short, created between Bessy and himself
a retrospective sympathy which the resumption of
life together would have dispelled in a week&mdash;one of the
exhalations from the past that depress the vitality of
those who linger too near the grave of dead experiences.</p>

<p>Since Justine's departure Amherst had felt himself
still more drawn to Cicely; but his relation to the
child was complicated by the fact that she would not
be satisfied as to the cause of her step-mother's absence.
Whenever Amherst came to town, her first question was
for Justine; and her memory had the precocious persistence
sometimes developed in children too early deprived
of their natural atmosphere of affection. Cicely
had always been petted and adored, at odd times and
by divers people; but some instinct seemed to tell her
that, of all the tenderness bestowed on her, Justine's
most resembled the all-pervading motherly element in
which the child's heart expands without ever being
conscious of its needs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[p 590]</a></span></p>

<p>If it had been embarrassing to evade Cicely's questions
in June it became doubly so as the months passed,
and the pretext of Justine's ill-health grew more and
more difficult to sustain. And in the following March
Amherst was suddenly called from Hanaford by the
news that the little girl herself was ill. Serious complications
had developed from a protracted case of
scarlet fever, and for two weeks the child's fate was
uncertain. Then she began to recover, and in the joy
of seeing life come back to her, Mr. Langhope and
Amherst felt as though they must not only gratify every
wish she expressed, but try to guess at those they saw
floating below the surface of her clear vague eyes.</p>

<p>It was noticeable to Mrs. Ansell, if not to the others,
that one of these unexpressed wishes was the desire to
see her stepmother. Cicely no longer asked for Justine;
but something in her silence, or in the gesture
with which she gently put from her other offers of
diversion and companionship, suddenly struck Mrs.
Ansell as more poignant than speech.</p>

<p>"What is it the child wants?" she asked the governess,
in the course of one of their whispered consultations;
and the governess, after a moment's hesitation,
replied: "She said something about a letter she wrote
to Mrs. Amherst just before she was taken ill&mdash;about
having had no answer, I think."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;she writes to Mrs. Amherst, does she?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[p 591]</a></span></p>

<p>The governess, evidently aware that she trod on
delicate ground, tried at once to defend herself and her
pupil.</p>

<p>"It was my fault, perhaps. I suggested once that
her little compositions should take the form of letters&mdash;it
usually interests a child more&mdash;and she asked if
they might be written to Mrs. Amherst."</p>

<p>"Your fault? Why should not the child write to
her step-mother?" Mrs. Ansell rejoined with studied
surprise; and on the other's murmuring: "Of course&mdash;of
course&mdash;&mdash;" she added haughtily: "I trust the
letters were sent?"</p>

<p>The governess floundered. "I couldn't say&mdash;but
perhaps the nurse...."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That evening Cicely was less well. There was a slight
return of fever, and the doctor, hastily summoned,
hinted at the possibility of too much excitement in the
sick-room.</p>

<p>"Excitement? There has been no excitement," Mr.
Langhope protested, quivering with the sudden renewal
of fear.</p>

<p>"No? The child seemed nervous, uneasy. It's
hard to say why, because she is unusually reserved for
her age."</p>

<p>The medical man took his departure, and Mr. Langhope
and Mrs. Ansell faced each other in the disarray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[p 592]</a></span>
produced by a call to arms when all has seemed at
peace.</p>

<p>"I shall lose her&mdash;I shall lose her!" the grandfather
broke out, sinking into his chair with a groan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, gathering up her furs for departure,
turned on him abruptly from the threshold.</p>

<p>"It's stupid, what you're doing&mdash;stupid!" she exclaimed
with unwonted vehemence.</p>

<p>He raised his head with a startled look. "What do
you mean&mdash;what I'm doing?"</p>

<p>"The child misses Justine. You ought to send for
her."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope's hands dropped to the arms of his
chair, and he straightened himself up with a pale flash
of indignation. "You've had moments lately&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I've had moments, yes; and so have you&mdash;when
the child came back to us, and we stood there and wondered
how we could keep her, tie her fast...and in
those moments I saw...saw what she wanted...and
so did you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope turned away his head. "You're a
sentimentalist!" he flung scornfully back.</p>

<p>"Oh, call me any bad names you please!"</p>

<p>"I won't send for that woman!"</p>

<p>"No." She fastened her furs slowly, with the gentle
deliberate movements that no emotion ever hastened
or disturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[p 593]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you say no?" he challenged her.</p>

<p>"To make you contradict me, perhaps," she ventured,
after looking at him again.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;&mdash;" He shifted his position, one elbow supporting
his bowed head, his eyes fixed on the ground.
Presently he brought out: "Could one ask her to
come&mdash;and see the child&mdash;and go away again&mdash;for
good?"</p>

<p>"To break the compact at your pleasure, and enter
into it again for the same reason?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I see." He paused, and then looked up
at her suddenly. "But what if Amherst won't have
her back himself?"</p>

<p>"Shall I ask him?"</p>

<p>"I tell you he can't bear to hear her name!"</p>

<p>"But he doesn't know why she has left him."</p>

<p>Mr. Langhope gathered his brows in a frown. "Why&mdash;what
on earth&mdash;what possible difference would that
make?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, from the doorway, shed a pitying glance
on him. "Ah&mdash;if you don't see!" she murmured.</p>

<p>He sank back into his seat with a groan. "Good
heavens, Maria, how you torture me! I see enough
as it is&mdash;I see too much of the cursed business!"</p>

<p>She paused again, and then slowly moved a step or
two nearer, laying her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"There's one thing you've never seen yet, Henry:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[p 594]</a></span>
what Bessy herself would do now&mdash;for the child&mdash;if she
could."</p>

<p>He sat motionless under her light touch, his eyes on
hers, till their inmost thoughts felt for and found each
other, as they still sometimes could, through the fog of
years and selfishness and worldly habit; then he
dropped his face into his hands, hiding it from her with
the instinctive shrinking of an aged grief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amherst</span>, Cicely's convalescence once assured,
had been obliged to go back to Hanaford; but
some ten days later, on hearing from Mrs. Ansell that
the little girl's progress was less rapid than had been
hoped, he returned to his father-in-law's for a Sunday.</p>

<p>He came two days after the talk recorded in the last
chapter&mdash;a talk of which Mrs. Ansell's letter to him had
been the direct result. She had promised Mr. Langhope
that, in writing to Amherst, she would not go
beyond the briefest statement of fact; and she had
kept her word, trusting to circumstances to speak for
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, during Cicely's illness, had formed the
habit of dropping in on Mr. Langhope at the tea
hour instead of awaiting him in her own drawing-room;
and on the Sunday in question she found him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[p 595]</a></span>
alone. Beneath his pleasure in seeing her, which had
grown more marked as his dependence on her increased,
she at once discerned traces of recent disturbance;
and her first question was for Cicely.</p>

<p>He met it with a discouraged gesture. "No great
change&mdash;Amherst finds her less well than when he was
here before."</p>

<p>"He's upstairs with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she seems to want him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell seated herself in silence behind the tea-tray,
of which she was now recognized as the officiating
priestess. As she drew off her long gloves, and mechanically
straightened the row of delicate old cups,
Mr. Langhope added with an effort: "I've spoken to
him&mdash;told him what you said."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"About the child's wish," he continued. "About
her having written to his wife. It seems her last letters
have not been answered."</p>

<p>He paused, and Mrs. Ansell, with her usual calm
precision, proceeded to measure the tea into the fluted
Georgian tea-pot. She could be as reticent in approval
as in reprehension, and not for the world would she
have seemed to claim any share in the turn that events
appeared to be taking. She even preferred the risk of
leaving her old friend to add half-reproachfully: "I
told Amherst what you and the nurse thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[p 596]</a></span>"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"That Cicely pines for his wife. I put it to him in
black and white." The words came out on a deep
strained breath, and Mrs. Ansell faltered: "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he doesn't know where she is himself."</p>

<p>"Doesn't <i>know</i>?"</p>

<p>"They're separated&mdash;utterly separated. It's as I
told you: he could hardly name her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell had unconsciously ceased her ministrations,
letting her hands fall on her knee while she
brooded in blank wonder on her companion's face.</p>

<p>"I wonder what reason she could have given him?"
she murmured at length.</p>

<p>"For going? He loathes her, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but <i>how did she make him</i>?"</p>

<p>He struck his hand violently on the arm of his chair.
"Upon my soul, you seem to forget!"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head with a half smile. "I
simply remember more than you do."</p>

<p>"What more?" he began with a flush of anger; but
she raised a quieting hand.</p>

<p>"What does all that matter&mdash;if, now that we need
her, we can't get her?"</p>

<p>He made no answer, and she returned to the dispensing
of his tea; but as she rose to put the cup in
his hand he asked, half querulously: "You think it's
going to be very bad for the child, then?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[p 597]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell smiled with the thin edge of her lips.
"One can hardly set the police after her&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"No; we're powerless," he groaned in assent.</p>

<p>As the cup passed between them she dropped her
eyes to his with a quick flash of interrogation; but he
sat staring moodily before him, and she moved back
to the sofa without a word.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the way downstairs she met Amherst descending
from Cicely's room.</p>

<p>Since the early days of his first marriage there had
always been, on Amherst's side, a sense of obscure antagonism
toward Mrs. Ansell. She was almost the
embodied spirit of the world he dreaded and disliked:
her serenity, her tolerance, her adaptability, seemed to
smile away and disintegrate all the high enthusiasms,
the stubborn convictions, that he had tried to plant in
the shifting sands of his married life. And now that
Bessy's death had given her back the attributes with
which his fancy had originally invested her, he had
come to regard Mrs. Ansell as embodying the evil influences
that had come between himself and his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell was probably not unaware of the successive
transitions of feeling which had led up to this
unflattering view; but her life had been passed among
petty rivalries and animosities, and she had the patience
and adroitness of the spy in a hostile camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[p 598]</a></span></p>

<p>She and Amherst exchanged a few words about
Cicely; then she exclaimed, with a glance through the
panes of the hall door: "But I must be off&mdash;I'm on foot,
and the crossings appal me after dark."</p>

<p>He could do no less, at that, than offer to guide her
across the perils of Fifth Avenue; and still talking of
Cicely, she led him down the thronged thoroughfare till
her own corner was reached, and then her own door;
turning there to ask, as if by an afterthought: "Won't
you come up? There's one thing more I want to say."</p>

<p>A shade of reluctance crossed his face, which, as the
vestibule light fell on it, looked hard and tired, like a
face set obstinately against a winter gale; but he murmured
a word of assent, and followed her into the
shining steel cage of the lift.</p>

<p>In her little drawing-room, among the shaded lamps
and bowls of spring flowers, she pushed a chair forward,
settled herself in her usual corner of the sofa, and said
with a directness that seemed an echo of his own tone:
"I asked you to come up because I want to talk to you
about Mr. Langhope."</p>

<p>Amherst looked at her in surprise. Though his
father-in-law's health had been more or less unsatisfactory
for the last year, all their concern, of late, had
been for Cicely.</p>

<p>"You think him less well?" he enquired.</p>

<p>She waited to draw off and smooth her gloves, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[p 599]</a></span>
one of the deliberate gestures that served to shade and
supplement her speech.</p>

<p>"I think him extremely unhappy."</p>

<p>Amherst moved uneasily in his seat. He did not
know where she meant the talk to lead them, but he
guessed that it would be over painful places, and he
saw no reason why he should be forced to follow her.</p>

<p>"You mean that he's still anxious about Cicely?"</p>

<p>"Partly that&mdash;yes." She paused. "The child will
get well, no doubt; but she is very lonely. She needs
youth, heat, light. Mr. Langhope can't give her those,
or even a semblance of them; and it's an art I've lost
the secret of," she added with her shadowy smile.</p>

<p>Amherst's brows darkened. "I realize all she has
lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell glanced up at him quickly. "She is
twice motherless," she said.</p>

<p>The blood rose to his neck and temples, and he
tightened his hand on the arm of his chair. But it was
a part of Mrs. Ansell's expertness to know when such
danger signals must be heeded and when they might be
ignored, and she went on quietly: "It's the question of
the future that is troubling Mr. Langhope. After such
an illness, the next months of Cicely's life should be
all happiness. And money won't buy the kind she
needs: one can't pick out the right companion for such
a child as one can match a ribbon. What she wants is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[p 600]</a></span>
spontaneous affection, not the most superlative manufactured
article. She wants the sort of love that Justine
gave her."</p>

<p>It was the first time in months that Amherst had
heard his wife's name spoken outside of his own house.
No one but his mother mentioned Justine to him now;
and of late even his mother had dropped her enquiries
and allusions, prudently acquiescing in the habit of
silence which his own silence had created about him.
To hear the name again&mdash;the two little syllables which
had been the key of life to him, and now shook him as
the turning of a rusted lock shakes a long-closed door&mdash;to
hear her name spoken familiarly, affectionately, as
one speaks of some one who may come into the room
the next moment&mdash;gave him a shock that was half pain,
and half furtive unacknowledged joy. Men whose conscious
thoughts are mostly projected outward, on the
world of external activities, may be more moved by
such a touch on the feelings than those who are perpetually
testing and tuning their emotional chords.
Amherst had foreseen from the first that Mrs. Ansell
might mean to speak of his wife; but though he
had intended, if she did so, to cut their talk short,
he now felt himself irresistibly constrained to hear
her out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, having sped her shaft, followed its flight
through lowered lashes, and saw that it had struck a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[p 601]</a></span>
vulnerable point; but she was far from assuming that
the day was won.</p>

<p>"I believe," she continued, "that Mr. Langhope has
said something of this to you already, and my only
excuse for speaking is that I understood he had not been
successful in his appeal."</p>

<p>No one but Mrs. Ansell&mdash;and perhaps she knew it&mdash;could
have pushed so far beyond the conventional limits
of discretion without seeming to overstep them by a
hair; and she had often said, when pressed for the
secret of her art, that it consisted simply in knowing
the pass-word. That word once spoken, she might have
added, the next secret was to give the enemy no time for
resistance; and though she saw the frown reappear between
Amherst's eyes, she went on, without heeding it:
"I entreat you, Mr. Amherst, to let Cicely see your wife."</p>

<p>He reddened again, and pushed back his chair, as
if to rise.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't break off like that! Let me say a word
more. I know your answer to Mr. Langhope&mdash;that
you and Justine are no longer together. But I thought
of you as a man to sink your personal relations at such
a moment as this."</p>

<p>"To sink them?" he repeated vaguely: and she went
on: "After all, what difference does it make?"</p>

<p>"What difference?" He stared in unmitigated wonder,
and then answered, with a touch of irony: "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[p 602]</a></span>
might at least make the difference of my being unwilling
to ask a favour of her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell, at this, raised her eyes and let them rest
full on his. "Because she has done you so great a one
already?"</p>

<p>He stared again, sinking back automatically into his
chair. "I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"No." She smiled a little, as if to give herself time.
"But I mean that you shall. If I were a man I suppose
I couldn't, because a man's code of honour is such a
clumsy cast-iron thing. But a woman's, luckily, can
be cut over&mdash;if she's clever&mdash;to fit any new occasion;
and in this case I should be willing to reduce mine to
tatters if necessary."</p>

<p>Amherst's look of bewilderment deepened. "What
is it that I don't understand?" he asked at length, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;first of all, why Mr. Langhope had the right
to ask you to send for your wife."</p>

<p>"The right?"</p>

<p>"You don't recognize such a right on his part?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;why should I?"</p>

<p>"Supposing she had left you by his wish?"</p>

<p>"His wish? <i>His&mdash;&mdash;?</i>"</p>

<p>He was on his feet now, gazing at her blindly, while
the solid world seemed to grow thin about him. Her
next words reduced it to a mist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[p 603]</a></span></p>

<p>"My poor Amherst&mdash;why else, on earth, should she
have left you?"</p>

<p>She brought it out clearly, in her small chiming tones;
and as the sound travelled toward him it seemed to
gather momentum, till her words rang through his brain
as if every incomprehensible incident in the past had
suddenly boomed forth the question. Why else, indeed,
should she have left him? He stood motionless
for a while; then he approached Mrs. Ansell and said:
"Tell me."</p>

<p>She drew farther back into her corner of the sofa,
waving him to a seat beside her, as though to bring his
inquisitory eyes on a level where her own could command
them; but he stood where he was, unconscious
of her gesture, and merely repeating: "Tell me."</p>

<p>She may have said to herself that a woman would
have needed no farther telling; but to him she only
replied, slanting her head up to his: "To spare you and
himself pain&mdash;to keep everything, between himself and
you, as it had been before you married her."</p>

<p>He dropped down beside her at that, grasping the
back of the sofa as if he wanted something to clutch
and throttle. The veins swelled in his temples, and as
he pushed back his tossed hair Mrs. Ansell noticed for
the first time how gray it had grown on the under side.</p>

<p>"And he asked this of my wife&mdash;he accepted it?'"</p>

<p>"Haven't <i>you</i> accepted it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[p 604]</a></span></p>

<p>"I? How could I guess her reasons&mdash;how could I
imagine&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell raised her brows a hair's breadth at
that. "I don't know. But as a fact, he didn't ask&mdash;it
was she who offered, who forced it on him, even!"</p>

<p>"Forced her going on him?"</p>

<p>"In a sense, yes; by making it appear that <i>you</i> felt
as he did about&mdash;about poor Bessy's death: that the
thought of what had happened at that time was as
abhorrent to you as to him&mdash;that <i>she</i> was as abhorrent
to you. No doubt she foresaw that, had she permitted
the least doubt on that point, there would have been
no need of her leaving you, since the relation between
yourself and Mr. Langhope would have been altered&mdash;destroyed...."</p>

<p>"Yes. I expected that&mdash;I warned her of it. But
how did she make him think&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? To begin with, I don't know
your real feeling. For all I know she was telling the
truth&mdash;and Mr. Langhope of course thought she was."</p>

<p>"That I abhorred her? Oh&mdash;&mdash;" he broke out, on
his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why did I let her leave me?" He strode across the
room, as his habit was in moments of agitation, turning
back to her again before he answered. "Because I
<i>didn't</i> know&mdash;didn't know anything! And because her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[p 605]</a></span>
insisting on going away like that, without any explanation,
made me feel...imagine there was...something
she didn't <i>want</i> me to know...something she
was afraid of not being able to hide from me if we
stayed together any longer."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there was: the extent to which she loved
you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell; her hands clasped on her knee, her gaze
holding his with a kind of visionary fixity, seemed to
reconstruct the history of his past, bit by bit, with the
words she was dragging out of him.</p>

<p>"I see it&mdash;I see it all now," she went on, with a repressed
fervour that he had never divined in her. "It
was the only solution for her, as well as for the rest of
you. The more she showed her love, the more it would
have cast a doubt on her motive...the greater distance
she would have put between herself and you.
And so she showed it in the only way that was safe for
both of you, by taking herself away and hiding it in
her heart; and before going, she secured your peace of
mind, your future. If she ruined anything, she rebuilt
the ruin. Oh, she paid&mdash;she paid in full!"</p>

<p>Justine had paid, yes&mdash;paid to the utmost limit of
whatever debt toward society she had contracted by
overstepping its laws. And her resolve to discharge the
debt had been taken in a flash, as soon as she had seen
that man can commit no act alone, whether for good or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[p 606]</a></span>
evil. The extent to which Amherst's fate was involved
in hers had become clear to her with his first word of
reassurance, of faith in her motive. And instantly a
plan for releasing him had leapt full-formed into her
mind, and had been carried out with swift unflinching
resolution. As he forced himself, now, to look down
the suddenly illuminated past to the weeks which had
elapsed between her visit to Mr. Langhope and her departure
from Hanaford, he wondered not so much at
her swiftness of resolve as at her firmness in carrying
out her plan&mdash;and he saw, with a blinding flash of insight,
that it was in her love for him that she had found
her strength.</p>

<p>In all moments of strong mental tension he became
totally unconscious of time and place, and he now remained
silent so long, his hands clasped behind him,
his eyes fixed on an indeterminate point in space, that
Mrs. Ansell at length rose and laid a questioning touch
on his arm.</p>

<p>"It's not true that you don't know where she is?"
His face contracted. "At this moment I don't.
Lately she has preferred...not to write...."</p>

<p>"But surely you must know how to find her?"</p>

<p>He tossed back his hair with an energetic movement.
"I should find her if I didn't know how!"</p>

<p>They stood confronted in a gaze of silent intensity,
each penetrating farther into the mind of the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[p 607]</a></span>
than would once have seemed possible to either one;
then Amherst held out his hand abruptly. "Good-bye&mdash;and
thank you," he said.</p>

<p>She detained him a moment. "We shall see you
soon again&mdash;see you both?"</p>

<p>His face grew stern. "It's not to oblige Mr. Langhope
that I am going to find my wife."</p>

<p>"Ah, now you are unjust to him!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Don't let us speak of him!" he broke in.</p>

<p>"Why not? When it is from him the request comes&mdash;the
entreaty&mdash;that everything in the past should be
forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when it suits his convenience!"</p>

<p>"Do you imagine that&mdash;even judging him in that
way&mdash;it has not cost him a struggle?"</p>

<p>"I can only think of what it has cost her!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell drew a deep sighing breath. "Ah&mdash;but
don't you see that she has gained her point, and
that nothing else matters to her?"</p>

<p>"Gained her point? Not if, by that, you mean
that things here can ever go back to the old state&mdash;that
she and I can remain at Westmore after
this!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansell dropped her eyes for a moment; then
she lifted to his her sweet impenetrable face.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you have to do&mdash;both you and
he? Exactly what she decides," she affirmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[p 608]</a></span>.</p>

<h2><a name="XLII" id="XLII"></a>XLII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Justine's</span> answer to her husband's letter bore a
New York address; and the surprise of finding
her in the same town with himself, and not half an
hour's walk from the room in which he sat, was so
great that it seemed to demand some sudden and violent
outlet of physical movement.</p>

<p>He thrust the letter in his pocket, took up his hat,
and leaving the house, strode up Fifth Avenue toward
the Park in the early spring sunlight.</p>

<p>The news had taken five days to reach him, for in
order to reestablish communication with his wife he
had been obliged to write to Michigan, with the request
that his letter should be forwarded. He had never supposed
that Justine would be hard to find, or that she
had purposely enveloped her movements in mystery.
When she ceased to write he had simply concluded
that, like himself, she felt the mockery of trying to
keep up a sort of distant, semi-fraternal relation,
marked by the occasional interchange of inexpressive
letters. The inextricable mingling of thought and sensation
which made the peculiar closeness of their union
could never, to such direct and passionate natures, be
replaced by the pretense of a temperate friendship.
Feeling thus himself, and instinctively assuming the
same feeling in his wife, Amherst had respected her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[p 609]</a></span>
silence, her wish to break definitely with their former
life. She had written him, in the autumn, that she
intended to leave Michigan for a few months, but that,
in any emergency, a letter addressed to her friend's
house would reach her; and he had taken this as meaning
that, unless the emergency arose, she preferred that
their correspondence should cease. Acquiescence was
all the easier because it accorded with his own desire.
It seemed to him, as he looked back, that the love he
and Justine had felt for each other was like some rare
organism which could maintain life only in its special
element; and that element was neither passion nor
sentiment, but truth. It was only on the heights that
they could breathe.</p>

<p>Some men, in his place, even while accepting the inevitableness
of the moral rupture, would have felt concerned
for the material side of the case. But it was
characteristic of Amherst that this did not trouble him.
He took it for granted that his wife would return to her
nursing. From the first he had felt certain that it
would be intolerable to her to accept aid from him, and
that she would choose rather to support herself by the
exercise of her regular profession; and, aside from such
motives, he, who had always turned to hard work as
the rarest refuge from personal misery, thought it natural
that she should seek the same means of escape.</p>

<p>He had therefore not been surprised, on opening her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[p 610]</a></span>
letter that morning, to learn that she had taken up her
hospital work; but in the amazement of finding her
so near he hardly grasped her explanation of the coincidence.
There was something about a Buffalo patient
suddenly ordered to New York for special treatment,
and refusing to go in with a new nurse&mdash;but these details
made no impression on his mind, which had only
room for the fact that chance had brought his wife
back at the very moment when his whole being yearned
for her.</p>

<p>She wrote that, owing to her duties, she would be
unable to see him till three that afternoon; and he had
still six hours to consume before their meeting. But in
spirit they had met already&mdash;they were one in an intensity
of communion which, as he strode northward
along the bright crowded thoroughfare, seemed to
gather up the whole world into one throbbing point of
life.</p>

<p>He had a boyish wish to keep the secret of his happiness
to himself, not to let Mr. Langhope or Mrs. Ansell
know of his meeting with Justine till it was over;
and after twice measuring the length of the Park he
turned in at one of the little wooden restaurants which
were beginning to unshutter themselves in anticipation
of spring custom. If only he could have seen Justine
that morning! If he could have brought her there,
and they could have sat opposite each other, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[p 611]</a></span>
bare empty room, with sparrows bustling and twittering
in the lilacs against the open window! The room
was ugly enough&mdash;but how she would have delighted
in the delicate green of the near slopes, and the purplish
haze of the woods beyond! She took a childish
pleasure in such small adventures, and had the knack
of giving a touch of magic to their most commonplace
details. Amherst, as he finished his cold beef and indifferent
eggs, found himself boyishly planning to bring
her back there the next day....</p>

<p>Then, over the coffee, he re-read her letter.</p>

<p>The address she gave was that of a small private hospital,
and she explained that she would have to receive
him in the public parlour, which at that hour was open
to other visitors. As the time approached, the thought
that they might not be alone when they met became
insufferable; and he determined, if he found any one
else, in possession of the parlour, to wait in the hall, and
meet her as she came down the stairs.</p>

<p>He continued to elaborate this plan as he walked
back slowly through the Park, He had timed himself
to reach the hospital a little before three; but though it
lacked five minutes to the hour when he entered the
parlour, two women were already seated in one of its
windows. They looked around as he came in, evidently
as much annoyed by his appearance as he had been to
find them there. The older of the two showed a sallow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[p 612]</a></span>
middle-aged face beneath her limp crape veil; the other
was a slight tawdry creature, with nodding feathers,
and innumerable chains and bracelets which she fingered
ceaselessly as she talked.</p>

<p>They eyed Amherst with resentment, and then turned
away, continuing their talk in low murmurs, while he
seated himself at the marble-topped table littered with
torn magazines. Now and then the younger woman's
voice rose in a shrill staccato, and a phrase or two
floated over to him. "She'd simply worked herself to
death&mdash;the nurse told me so.... She expects to go
home in another week, though how she's going to stand
the <i>fatigue</i>&mdash;&mdash;" and then, after an inaudible answer:
"It's all <i>his</i> fault, and if I was her I wouldn't go back
to him for anything!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cora, he's real sorry now," the older woman
protestingly murmured; but the other, unappeased, rejoined
with ominously nodding plumes: "<i>You</i> see&mdash;if
they do make it up, it'll never be the same between
them!"</p>

<p>Amherst started up nervously, and as he did so the
clock struck three, and he opened the door and passed
out into the hall. It was paved with black and white
marble; the walls were washed in a dull yellowish tint,
and the prevalent odour of antiseptics was mingled with
a stale smell of cooking. At the back rose a straight
staircase carpeted with brass-bound India-rubber, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[p 613]</a></span>
a ship's companion-way; and down that staircase she
would come in a moment&mdash;he fancied he heard her step
now....</p>

<p>But the step was that of an elderly black-gowned
woman in a cap&mdash;the matron probably.</p>

<p>She glanced at Amherst in surprise, and asked: "Are
you waiting for some one?"</p>

<p>He made a motion of assent, and she opened the parlour
door, saying: "Please walk in."</p>

<p>"May I not wait out here?" he urged.</p>

<p>She looked at him more attentively. "Why, no,
I'm afraid not. You'll find the papers and magazines
in here."</p>

<p>Mildly but firmly she drove him in before her, and
closing the door, advanced to the two women in the
window. Amherst's hopes leapt up: perhaps she had
come to fetch the visitors upstairs! He strained his
ears to catch what was being said, and while he was
thus absorbed the door opened, and turning at the
sound he found himself face to face with his wife.</p>

<p>He had not reflected that Justine would be in her
nurse's dress; and the sight of the dark blue uniform and
small white cap, in which he had never seen her since
their first meeting in the Hope Hospital, obliterated all
bitter and unhappy memories, and gave him the illusion
of passing back at once into the clear air of their early
friendship. Then he looked at her and remembered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[p 614]</a></span></p>

<p>He noticed that she had grown thinner than ever,
or rather that her thinness, which had formerly had a
healthy reed-like strength, now suggested fatigue and
languor. And her face was spent, extinguished&mdash;the
very eyes were lifeless. All her vitality seemed to have
withdrawn itself into the arch of dense black hair which
still clasped her forehead like the noble metal of some
antique bust.</p>

<p>The sight stirred him with a deeper pity, a more
vehement compunction; but the impulse to snatch her
to him, and seek his pardon on her lips, was paralyzed
by the sense that the three women in the window had
stopped talking and turned their heads toward the door.</p>

<p>He held his hand out, and Justine's touched it for a
moment; then he said in a low voice: "Is there no
other place where I can see you?"</p>

<p>She made a negative gesture. "I am afraid not to-day."</p>

<p>Ah, her deep sweet voice&mdash;how completely his ear
had lost the sound of it!</p>

<p>She looked doubtfully about the room, and pointed
to a sofa at the end farthest from the windows.</p>

<p>"Shall we sit there?" she said.</p>

<p>He followed her in silence, and they sat down side by
side. The matron had drawn up a chair and resumed
her whispered conference with the women in the window.
Between the two groups stretched the bare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[p 615]</a></span>
length of the room, broken only by a few arm-chairs
of stained wood, and the marble-topped table covered
with magazines.</p>

<p>The impossibility of giving free rein to his feelings
developed in Amherst an unwonted intensity of perception,
as though a sixth sense had suddenly emerged
to take the place of those he could not use. And with
this new-made faculty he seemed to gather up, and
absorb into himself, as he had never done in their
hours of closest communion, every detail of his wife's
person, of her face and hands and gestures. He noticed
how her full upper lids, of the tint of yellowish
ivory, had a slight bluish discolouration, and how little
thread-like blue veins ran across her temples to the
roots of her hair. The emaciation of her face, and the
hollow shades beneath her cheek-bones, made her
mouth seem redder and fuller, though a little line on
each side, where it joined the cheek, gave it a tragic
droop. And her hands! When her fingers met his
he recalled having once picked up, in the winter woods,
the little feather-light skeleton of a frozen bird&mdash;and
that was what her touch was like.</p>

<p>And it was he who had brought her to this by his
cruelty, his obtuseness, his base readiness to believe the
worst of her! He did not want to pour himself out in
self-accusation&mdash;that seemed too easy a way of escape.
He wanted simply to take her in his arms, to ask her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[p 616]</a></span>
to give him one more chance&mdash;and then to show her!
And all the while he was paralyzed by the group in the
window.</p>

<p>"Can't we go out? I must speak to you," he began
again nervously.</p>

<p>"Not this afternoon&mdash;the doctor is coming. Tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't wait for tomorrow!"</p>

<p>She made a faint, imperceptible gesture, which read
to his eyes: "You've waited a whole year."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," he returned, still constrained by the
necessity of muffling his voice, of perpetually measuring
the distance between themselves and the window. "I
know what you might say&mdash;don't you suppose I've said
it to myself a million times? But I didn't know&mdash;I
couldn't imagine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a rapid movement. "What
do you know now?"</p>

<p>"What you promised Langhope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned her startled eyes on him, and he saw the
blood run flame-like under her skin. "But <i>he</i> promised
not to speak!" she cried.</p>

<p>"He hasn't&mdash;to me. But such things make themselves
known. Should you have been content to go
on in that way forever?"</p>

<p>She raised her head and her eyes rested in his. "If
you were," she answered simply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[p 617]</a></span></p>

<p>"Justine!"</p>

<p>Again she checked him with a silencing motion.
"Please tell me just what has happened."</p>

<p>"Not now&mdash;there's too much else to say. And
nothing matters except that I'm with you."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Langhope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He asks you to come. You're to see Cicely to-morrow."</p>

<p>Her lower lip trembled a little, and a tear flowed
over and hung on her lashes.</p>

<p>"But what does all that matter now? We're together
after this horrible year," he insisted.</p>

<p>She looked at him again. "But what is really
changed?"</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;everything! Not changed, I mean&mdash;just
gone back."</p>

<p>"To where...we were...before?" she whispered;
and he whispered back: "To where we were
before."</p>

<p>There was a scraping of chairs on the floor, and
with a sense of release Amherst saw that the colloquy
in the window was over.</p>

<p>The two visitors, gathering their wraps about them,
moved slowly across the room, still talking to the
matron in excited undertones, through which, as they
neared the threshold, the younger woman's staccato
again broke out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[p 618]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, if she does go back to him, it'll never
be the same between them!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cora, I wouldn't say that," the other ineffectually
wailed; then they moved toward the door, and a
moment later it had closed on them.</p>

<p>Amherst turned to his wife with outstretched arms.
"Say you forgive me, Justine!"</p>

<p>She held back a little from his entreating hands, not
reproachfully, but as if with a last scruple for himself.</p>

<p>"There's nothing left...of the horror?" she asked
below her breath.</p>

<p>"To be without you&mdash;that's the only horror!"</p>

<p>"You're <i>sure</i>&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"It's just the same to you...just as it was...before?"</p>

<p>"Just the same, Justine!"</p>

<p>"It's not for myself, but you."</p>

<p>"Then, for me&mdash;never speak of it!" he implored.</p>

<p>"Because it's <i>not</i> the same, then?" leapt from her.</p>

<p>"Because it's wiped out&mdash;because it's never been!"</p>

<p>"Never?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>He felt her yield to him at that, and under his eyes, close
under his lips, was her face at last. But as they kissed they
heard the handle of the door turn, and drew apart quickly,
her hand lingering in his under the fold of her dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[p 619]</a></span></p>

<p>A nurse looked in, dressed in the white uniform and
pointed cap of the hospital. Amherst fancied that she
smiled a little as she saw them.</p>

<p>"Miss Brent&mdash;the doctor wants you to come right
up and give the morphine."</p>

<p>The door shut again as Justine rose to her feet.
Amherst remained seated&mdash;he had made no motion to
retain her hand as it slipped from him.</p>

<p>"I'm coming," she called out to the retreating nurse;
then she turned slowly and saw her husband's face.</p>

<p>"I must go," she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>Her eyes met his for a moment; but he looked away
again as he stood up and reached for his hat.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, then&mdash;&mdash;" he said, without attempting
to detain her.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"You must come away from here&mdash;you must come
home," he repeated mechanically.</p>

<p>She made no answer, and he held his hand out and
took hers. "Tomorrow," he said, drawing her toward
him; and their lips met again, but not in the same kiss.</p>

<h2><a name="XLIII" id="XLIII"></a>XLIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">June</span> again at Hanaford&mdash;and Cicely's birthday.
The anniversary was to coincide, this year, with
the opening of the old house at Hopewood, as a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[p 620]</a></span>
pleasure-palace&mdash;gymnasium, concert-hall and museum&mdash;for
the recreation of the mill-hands.</p>

<p>The idea had first come to Amherst on the winter
afternoon when Bessy Westmore had confessed her
love for him under the snow-laden trees of Hopewood.
Even then the sense that his personal happiness was
enlarged and secured by its promise of happiness to
others had made him wish that the scene associated
with the opening of his new life should be made to
commemorate a corresponding change in the fortunes
of Westmore. But when the control of the mills passed
into his hands other and more necessary improvements
pressed upon him; and it was not till now that the
financial condition of the company had permitted the
execution of his plan.</p>

<p>Justine, on her return to Hanaford, had found the
work already in progress, and had been told by her
husband that he was carrying out a projected scheme
of Bessy's. She had felt a certain surprise, but had
concluded that the plan in question dated back to the
early days of his first marriage, when, in his wife's eyes,
his connection with the mills still invested them with
interest.</p>

<p>Since Justine had come back to her husband, both
had tacitly avoided all allusions to the past, and the
recreation-house at Hopewood being, as she divined,
in some sort an expiatory offering to Bessy's plaintive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[p 621]</a></span>
shade, she had purposely refrained from questioning
Amherst about its progress, and had simply approved
the plans he submitted to her.</p>

<p>Fourteen months had passed since her return, and
now, as she sat beside her husband in the carriage which
was conveying them to Hopewood, she said to herself
that her life had at last fallen into what promised to be
its final shape&mdash;that as things now were they would
probably be to the end. And outwardly at least they
were what she and Amherst had always dreamed of
their being. Westmore prospered under the new rule.
The seeds of life they had sown there were springing
up in a promising growth of bodily health and mental
activity, and above all in a dawning social consciousness.
The mill-hands were beginning to understand
the meaning of their work, in its relation to their own
lives and to the larger economy. And outwardly, also,
the new growth was showing itself in the humanized
aspect of the place. Amherst's young maples were tall
enough now to cast a shade on the grass-bordered
streets; and the well-kept turf, the bright cottage gardens,
the new central group of library, hospital and
club-house, gave to the mill-village the hopeful air of a
"rising" residential suburb.</p>

<p>In the bright June light, behind their fresh green
mantle of trees and creepers, even the factory buildings
looked less stern and prison-like than formerly; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[p 622]</a></span>
the turfing and planting of the adjoining river-banks
had transformed a waste of foul mud and refuse into
a little park where the operatives might refresh themselves
at midday.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;Westmore was alive at last: the dead city of
which Justine had once spoken had risen from its grave,
and its blank face had taken on a meaning. As Justine
glanced at her husband she saw that the same thought
was in his mind. However achieved, at whatever cost
of personal misery and error, the work of awakening and
freeing Westmore was done, and that work had justified
itself.</p>

<p>She looked from Amherst to Cicely, who sat opposite,
eager and rosy in her mourning frock&mdash;for Mr. Langhope
had died some two months previously&mdash;and as
intent as her step-parents on the scene before her.
Cicely was old enough now to regard her connection
with Westmore as something more than a nursery game.
She was beginning to learn a great deal about the mills,
and to understand, in simple, friendly ways, something
of her own relation to them. The work and play of
the children, the interests and relaxations provided for
their elders, had been gradually explained to her by
Justine, and she knew that this shining tenth birthday
of hers was to throw its light as far as the clouds of
factory-smoke extended.</p>

<p>As they mounted the slope to Hopewood, the spacious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[p 623]</a></span>
white building, with its enfolding colonnades, its broad
terraces and tennis-courts, shone through the trees like
some bright country-house adorned for its master's
home-coming; and Amherst and his wife might have
been driving up to the house which had been built to
shelter their wedded happiness. The thought flashed
across Justine as their carriage climbed the hill. She
was as much absorbed as Amherst in the welfare of
Westmore, it had become more and more, to both, the
refuge in which their lives still met and mingled; but for
a moment, as they paused before the flower-decked
porch, and he turned to help her from the carriage, it occurred
to her to wonder what her sensations would have
been if he had been bringing her home&mdash;to a real home
of their own&mdash;instead of accompanying her to another
philanthropic celebration. But what need had they of
a real home, when they no longer had any real life of
their own? Nothing was left of that secret inner union
which had so enriched and beautified their outward
lives. Since Justine's return to Hanaford they had
entered, tacitly, almost unconsciously, into a new relation
to each other: a relation in which their personalities
were more and more merged in their common work,
so that, as it were, they met only by avoiding each
other.</p>

<p>From the first, Justine had accepted this as inevitable;
just as she had understood, when Amherst had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[p 624]</a></span>
sought her out in New York, that his remaining at
Westmore, which had once been contingent on her
leaving him, now depended on her willingness to return
and take up their former life.</p>

<p>She accepted the last condition as she had accepted
the other, pledged to the perpetual expiation of an act
for which, in the abstract, she still refused to hold herself
to blame. But life is not a matter of abstract principles,
but a succession of pitiful compromises with fate,
of concessions to old tradition, old beliefs, old charities
and frailties. That was what her act had taught her&mdash;that
was the word of the gods to the mortal who had
laid a hand on their bolts. And she had humbled herself
to accept the lesson, seeing human relations at last
as a tangled and deep-rooted growth, a dark forest
through which the idealist cannot cut his straight path
without hearing at each stroke the cry of the severed
branch: "<i>Why woundest thou me?</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The lawns leading up to the house were already
sprinkled with holiday-makers, while along the avenue
came the rolling of wheels, the throb of motor-cars;
and Justine, with Cicely beside her, stood in the wide
hall to receive the incoming throng, in which Hanaford
society was indiscriminately mingled with the operatives
in their Sunday best.</p>

<p>While his wife welcomed the new arrivals, Amherst,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[p 625]</a></span>
supported by some young Westmore cousins, was guiding
them into the concert-hall, where he was to say a
word on the uses of the building before declaring it
open for inspection. And presently Justine and Cicely,
summoned by Westy Gaines, made their way through
the rows of seats to a corner near the platform. Her
husband was there already, with Halford Gaines and
a group of Hanaford dignitaries, and just below them
sat Mrs. Gaines and her daughters, the Harry Dressels,
and Amherst's radiant mother.</p>

<p>As Justine passed between them, she wondered how
much they knew of the events which had wrought so
profound and permanent change in her life. She had
never known how Hanaford explained her absence or
what comments it had made on her return. But she
saw to-day more clearly than ever that Amherst had
become a power among his townsmen, and that if they
were still blind to the inner meaning of his work, its
practical results were beginning to impress them profoundly.
Hanaford's sociological creed was largely
based on commercial considerations, and Amherst had
won Hanaford's esteem by the novel feat of defying its
economic principles and snatching success out of his
defiance.</p>

<p>And now he had advanced a step or two in front of
the "representative" semi-circle on the platform, and
was beginning to speak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[p 626]</a></span></p>

<p>Justine did not hear his first words. She was looking
up at him, trying to see him with the eyes of the crowd,
and wondering what manner of man he would have
seemed to her if she had known as little as they did of
his inner history.</p>

<p>He held himself straight, the heavy locks thrown back
from his forehead, one hand resting on the table beside
him, the other grasping a folded blue-print which the
architect of the building had just advanced to give him.
As he stood there, Justine recalled her first sight of him
in the Hope Hospital, five years earlier&mdash;was it only
five years? They had dealt deep strokes to his face,
hollowing the eye-sockets, accentuating the strong
modelling of nose and chin, fixing the lines between the
brows; but every touch had a meaning&mdash;it was not the
languid hand of time which had remade his features,
but the sharp chisel of thought and action.</p>

<p>She roused herself suddenly to the consciousness of
what he was saying.</p>

<p>"For the idea of this building&mdash;of a building dedicated
to the recreation of Westmore&mdash;is not new in my
mind; but while it remained there as a mere idea, it
had already, without my knowledge, taken definite
shape in the thoughts of the owner of Westmore."</p>

<p>There was a slight drop in his voice as he designated
Bessy, and he waited a moment before continuing: "It
was not till after the death of my first wife that I learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[p 627]</a></span>
of her intention&mdash;that I found by accident, among her
papers, this carefully-studied plan for a pleasure-house
at Hopewood."</p>

<p>He paused again, and unrolling the blue-print, held
it up before his audience.</p>

<p>"You cannot, at this distance," he went on, "see all
the admirable details of her plan; see how beautifully
they were imagined, how carefully and intelligently
elaborated. She who conceived them longed to see
beauty everywhere&mdash;it was her dearest wish to bestow
it on her people here. And her ardent imagination
outran the bounds of practical possibility. We cannot
give you, in its completeness, the beautiful thing she
had imagined&mdash;the great terraces, the marble porches,
the fountains, lily-tanks, and cloisters. But you will
see that, wherever it was possible&mdash;though in humbler
materials, and on a smaller scale&mdash;we have faithfully
followed her design; and when presently you go through
this building, and when, hereafter, you find health and
refreshment and diversion here, I ask you to remember
the beauty she dreamed of giving you, and to let the
thought of it make her memory beautiful among you
and among your children...."</p>

<p>Justine had listened with deepening amazement. She
was seated so close to her husband that she had recognized
the blue-print the moment he unrolled it. There
was no mistaking its origin&mdash;it was simply the plan of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[p 628]</a></span>
the gymnasium which Bessy had intended to build at
Lynbrook, and which she had been constrained to
abandon owing to her husband's increased expenditure
at the mills. But how was it possible that Amherst
knew nothing of the original purpose of the plans, and
by what mocking turn of events had a project devised
in deliberate defiance of his wishes, and intended to
declare his wife's open contempt for them, been transformed
into a Utopian vision for the betterment of the
Westmore operatives?</p>

<p>A wave of anger swept over Justine at this last derisive
stroke of fate. It was grotesque and pitiable that
a man like Amherst should create out of his regrets
a being who had never existed, and then ascribe to her
feelings and actions of which the real woman had again
and again proved herself incapable!</p>

<p>Ah, no, Justine had suffered enough&mdash;but to have
this imaginary Bessy called from the grave, dressed in
a semblance of self-devotion and idealism, to see her
petty impulses of vindictiveness disguised as the motions
of a lofty spirit&mdash;it was as though her small malicious
ghost had devised this way of punishing the wife
who had taken her place!</p>

<p>Justine had suffered enough&mdash;suffered deliberately
and unstintingly, paying the full price of her error, not
seeking to evade its least consequence. But no sane
judgment could ask her to sit quiet under this last hal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[p 629]</a></span>lucination.
What! This unreal woman, this phantom
that Amherst's uneasy imagination had evoked, was to
come between himself and her, to supplant her first as
his wife, and then as his fellow-worker? Why should
she not cry out the truth to him, defend herself against
the dead who came back to rob her of such wedded
peace as was hers? She had only to tell the true story
of the plans to lay poor Bessy's ghost forever!</p>

<p>The confused throbbing impulses within her were
stifled under a long burst of applause&mdash;then she saw
Westy Gaines at her side again, and understood that
he had come to lead Cicely to the platform. For a
moment she clung jealously to the child's hand, hardly
aware of what she did, feeling only that she was being
thrust farther and farther into the background of the
life she had helped to call out of chaos. Then a contrary
impulse moved her. She gently freed Cicely's
hand, and a moment later, as she sat with bent head
and throbbing breast, she heard the child's treble
piping out above her:</p>

<p>"In my mother's name, I give this house to Westmore."</p>

<p>Applause again&mdash;and then Justine found herself enveloped
in a general murmur of compliment and congratulation.
Mr. Amherst had spoken admirably&mdash;a
"beautiful tribute&mdash;" ah, he had done poor Bessy justice!
And to think that till now Hanaford had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[p 630]</a></span>
fully known how she had the welfare of the mills at
heart&mdash;how it was really only <i>her</i> work that he was
carrying on there! Well, he had made that perfectly
clear&mdash;and no doubt Cicely was being taught to follow
in her mother's footsteps: everyone had noticed how
her step-father was associating her with the work at
the mills. And his little speech would, as it were, consecrate
the child's relation to that work, make it appear
to her as the continuance of a beautiful, a sacred
tradition....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And now it was over. The building had been inspected,
the operatives had dispersed, the Hanaford
company had rolled off down the avenue, Cicely, among
them, driving away tired and happy in Mrs. Dressel's
victoria, and Amherst and his wife were alone.</p>

<p>Amherst, after bidding good-bye to his last guests,
had gone back to the empty concert-room to fetch
the blue-print lying on the platform. He came back
with it, between the uneven rows of empty chairs,
and joined Justine, who stood waiting in the hall. His
face was slightly flushed, and his eyes had the light
which in happy moments burned through their veil of
thought.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on his wife's arm, and drawing her
toward a table spread out the blueprint before her.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen this, have you?" he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[p 631]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked down at the plan without answering,
reading in the left-hand corner the architect's conventional
inscription: "Swimming-tank and gymnasium
designed for Mrs. John Amherst."</p>

<p>Amherst looked up, perhaps struck by her silence.</p>

<p>"But perhaps you <i>have</i> seen it&mdash;at Lynbrook? It
must have been done while you were there."</p>

<p>The quickened throb of her blood rushed to her brain
like a signal. "Speak&mdash;speak now!" the signal commanded.</p>

<p>Justine continued to look fixedly at the plan. "Yes,
I have seen it," she said at length.</p>

<p>"At Lynbrook?"</p>

<p>"At Lynbrook."</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> showed it to you, I suppose&mdash;while I was
away?"</p>

<p>Justine hesitated again. "Yes, while you were away."</p>

<p>"And did she tell you anything about it, go into
details about her wishes, her intentions?"</p>

<p>Now was the moment&mdash;now! As her lips parted she
looked up at her husband. The illumination still lingered
on his face&mdash;and it was the face she loved. He
was waiting eagerly for her next word.</p>

<p>"No, I heard no details. I merely saw the plan
lying there."</p>

<p>She saw his look of disappointment. "She never
told you about it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[p 632]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;she never told me."</p>

<p>It was best so, after all. She understood that now.
It was now at last that she was paying her full price.</p>

<p>Amherst rolled up the plan with a sigh and pushed
it into the drawer of the table. It struck her that he
too had the look of one who has laid a ghost. He
turned to her and drew her hand through his arm.</p>

<p>"You're tired, dear. You ought to have driven back
with the others," he said.</p>

<p>"No, I would rather stay with you."</p>

<p>"You want to drain this good day to the dregs, as I
do?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, drawing her hand away.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a good day, isn't it?" he continued, looking
about him at the white-panelled walls, the vista of
large bright rooms seen through the folding doors.
"I feel as if we had reached a height, somehow&mdash;a
height where one might pause and draw breath for the
next climb. Don't you feel that too, Justine?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I feel it."</p>

<p>"Do you remember once, long ago&mdash;one day when
you and I and Cicely went on a picnic to hunt orchids&mdash;how
we got talking of the one best moment in life&mdash;the
moment when one wanted most to stop the clock?"</p>

<p>The colour rose in her face while he spoke. It was
a long time since he had referred to the early days of
their friendship&mdash;the days <i>before</i>....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[p 633]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," she said.</p>

<p>"And do you remember how we said that it was
with most of us as it was with Faust? That the moment
one wanted to hold fast to was not, in most lives,
the moment of keenest personal happiness, but the
other kind&mdash;the kind that would have seemed grey and
colourless at first: the moment when the meaning of
life began to come out from the mists&mdash;when one could
look out at last over the marsh one had drained?"</p>

<p>A tremor ran through Justine. "It was you who said
that," she said, half-smiling.</p>

<p>"But didn't you feel it with me? Don't you now?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I do now," she murmured.</p>

<p>He came close to her, and taking her hands in his,
kissed them one after the other.</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, "let us go out and look at the marsh
we have drained."</p>

<p>He turned and led her through the open doorway
to the terrace above the river. The sun was setting
behind the wooded slopes of Hopewood, and the trees
about the house stretched long blue shadows across the
lawn. Beyond them rose the smoke of Westmore.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2>The House of Mirth</h2>

<p>
"In my judgment 'The House of Mirth' is a story
of such vitality, of such artistic and moral insight, that it
will stand by itself in American fiction as a study of a
certain kind of society. The title is a stroke of genius in
irony, and gives the key to a novel of absorbing interest, as
relentless as life itself in its judgment, but deeply and beautifully
humanized at the end."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamilton W. Mabie.</span>

<p>"Mrs. Wharton has done many good things. She has
never done anything better than this."&mdash;<i>The Academy.</i></p>

the novelist.... A sterling piece of craftsmanship, a tale
which interests the reader at the start and never lets him
rest till the end is reached."&mdash;New York <i>Tribune</i>.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
